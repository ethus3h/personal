New Git tip for Web site: To make local branches for all remote branches for the remote called `upstream` (well, any branch with an identifier with `upstream/` in its name): `for remote in $(git branch -r | grep 'upstream/' | grep -v '\->'); do git branch --track "upstream-branches/${remote# }" "${remote# }"; done`

Quotations from personal retired repo (I think there were some?)

On packaging Node.js packages for Gentoo:

```
Only misery lies down this path. Every upstream project is a mess and
nobody cares, because implicitly, their roadmaps all involve realizing
that javascript is awful and abandoning the project. To get this stuff
in the tree, we would need a full-time devoted developer who just loves
javascript and is sexually aroused by having his time wasted.
```

Things facebook is good for:
- Staying in touch with people far away (like, ya know, email and telephones) 
- Messaging high school classmates thirty years later so you can get together and remember how much high school sucked 
- Being a stalker 
- Identity theft 
- ...?
