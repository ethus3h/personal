TO DO

Revert https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-history/commit/76d936c18be5c19065332e43acf29dbb24a19d50 and https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-history/commit/938b8b4ed265832a963a3bf53b80515c2e9a29fb and copy the `removing-2017dec23a24` folder from 76d936c18be5c19065332e43acf29dbb24a19d50 into the new version and re-commit. That is because it added extra copies of many files due to file name issue on Mac.
