{{AFC comment|1=The stumbling block of a lack of serious coverage is more of a sinkhole. Yes, the five sources given are (mostly) independent and reliable sources, but there is no ''significant'' coverage of Polyakov. This was the crux of the original deletion discussion, and despite some very heavy trimming (and a lot of work by Goldenshimmer) I still see no evidence of [[WP:42|The Golden Rule]] being met. What Polyakov needs is an article or three that is specifically about him and what he has done; NOT simply &quot;he's now the conductor, and he used to be at X and Y location.&quot; [[User:Primefac|Primefac]] ([[User talk:Primefac|talk]]) 22:06, 8 September 2016 (UTC)}}

{{AFC comment|1={{ping|Tseung Kwan O}}: The remaining five references from four separate sources all appear to me to be fully neutral, independent, and reliable coverage of Polyakov. They may stumble on the &quot;trivial&quot; part of the requirement, though. Was there something in them I was missing indicating that they come from a primary source? &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Wreathe','Centaur','serif';color:#2a1657;background:#e2daf1&quot;&gt;‚Äî&amp;#123;&amp;#123;u&amp;#124;[[User:Goldenshimmer|Goldenshimmer]]&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;#124;‚úùÔ∏è&amp;#124;ze/zer&amp;#124;üòπ&amp;#124;[[User:Goldenshimmer/T|T/C]]&amp;#124;‚òÆÔ∏è&amp;#124;John15:12&amp;#124;üçÇ&lt;/span&gt; 18:41, 8 September 2016 (UTC)}}

{{AFC comment|1=The references in this submission are affiliated with the subject involved (I can't really read Russian, but I've noticed that they all come from a common source which claims that Polyakov is part of their organization).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think this resolves the issues mentioned in the review ‚Äî I removed the Concerts section and a bunch of the trivial coverage sources.

@[[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]]: The AfD was when there were only a few spammy sources for the article. The article creator found more sources, so I incorporated some of them into the article. At that point, I submitted the article to AfC for reassessment, and it was declined for having too much trivial coverage. I removed the trivial coverage, leaving just the coverage that establishes notability, and resubmitted it. &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:'Wreathe','Centaur','serif';color:#2a1657;background:#e2daf1&quot;&gt;‚Äî&amp;#123;&amp;#123;u&amp;#124;[[User:Goldenshimmer|Goldenshimmer]]&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;#124;‚úùÔ∏è&amp;#124;ze/zer&amp;#124;üòπ&amp;#124;[[User:Goldenshimmer/T|T/C]]&amp;#124;‚òÆÔ∏è&amp;#124;John15:12&amp;#124;üçÇ&lt;/span&gt; 18:28, 9 July 2016 (UTC)&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

==Notability==

The AfD found her non-notable when her claims to notability were her modelling for Playboy, the controversy over her X Factor participation and her appearance on Snog, Marry, Avoid. Since the AfD, she has appeared on Celebrity Big Brother, which attracted enough coverage to meet [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 08:06, 26 March 2017 (UTC)

==Persistent removal of information==
Could the anonymous editor who keeps removing a section please discuss their concerns here? {{u|82.132.231.192}}; {{u|2a00:23c4:8106:b300:9cbc:a8f2:bccc:3874}}, {{u|82.132.212.177}}, {{u|91.75.162.6}}. The sentence being removed is ''In 2010, she auditioned for The X Factor as Chloe Victoria, but was dropped due to her criminal record and allegations that she was a sex worker, allegations she denied.'' It has two reliable references. The first section - that she auditioned for the X Factor as Chloe Victoria - should clearly stand. It's factual, cited, well-known and anyone can see it on Youtube. Why is this persistently being removed? The reasons she was dropped are also available in many reliable sources, and this article clearly states that she denied the allegations. If you feel this could be better written, to make it even clearer that she denied them, then feel free to suggest something. Obviously we want to be accurate as an encyclopaedia and not keep something significant out, but I'm also very sensitive to the fact that this is a biography of a living person. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 07:24, 30 April 2017 (UTC)

I've made a few changes to make it clearer; again, please discuss concerns so we can look at how to word this best. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 07:42, 30 April 2017 (UTC)

Most of the removal of information was given with edit summaries such as 'Update' or 'minor edit'. On 4th May, all the X Factor info was removed with edit summary from IP: ''Removed lies and false information . IPSO have ruled against these in the court of law and legal team will be involved if this defamation , abuse and trolling continues .'' Will see if WIkiproject can help. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 19:37, 7 May 2017 (UTC)

:I don't know what the IP has in mind. But this is not supported by either cited source (Metro or Telegraph): &quot;In 2010, she auditioned for The X Factor as Chloe Victoria, but was dropped due to her criminal record.&quot; Metro does not mention a criminal record. Telegraph does, but doesn't say that's why she was dropped. This article is subject to [[WP:BLP]] and it's important not to reach conclusions that aren't in the source. Also I wonder about the reliability of ''Metro''. [[User:Kendall-K1|Kendall-K1]] ([[User talk:Kendall-K1|talk]]) 21:36, 7 May 2017 (UTC)

The Telegraph says: ''She was kicked off the musical talent show after it was alleged that she had been a sex worker ‚Äì and that she was continuing to sell sex while The X Factor aired, but at a more expensive rate (leveraged by TV notoriety).'' You're right that the Metro (which I would consider reliable) states that she had a criminal record, but not that this was the reason for being kicked off the show and neither source given says what the reasons for this were. Thanks for looking at it and I'll re-word it. [[User:Boleyn|Boleyn]] ([[User talk:Boleyn|talk]]) 21:45, 7 May 2017 (UTC)
:The ''Metro'' does not mention a criminal record. It talks about &quot;run-ins with the police.&quot; I don't know about the UK, but in the US these are two different things. The Telegraph does say &quot;criminal record&quot; so I think it's ok to leave that in.
:I checked at [[WP:RSN]] and apparently ''Metro'' is considered reliable for this sort of information, in spite of its similarity to some US sources that are not. I do wonder about their ability to report the news factually, because they say Khan is a &quot;horrid person&quot; and that sounds more like opinion than news.

Weird, I'm using Chrome with no issues. Although OK's article doesn't mention it, it seems it's now owned by The Express Group, which own many publications, some reliable, some not. I haven't heard of any concerns about [[OK!]] and I've read it a few times, it's nothing like the Daily Express. I wouldn't use OK as a ref for a physics article, but fine for this.

:{{u|Kendall-K1}} &amp; {{u|Boleyn}} - I've asked at [[Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Okay_magazine]] if Okay magazine is okay as a source, Thanks, ‚Äì[[User:Davey2010|&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''Davey'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;'''2010'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Davey2010|&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;'''Talk'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:11, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
::Thanks. I'm leaning toward taking that paragraph out, but maybe we could find a more reliable source that says the same thing. If this guy really was her boyfriend it must have been reported elsewhere. [[User:Kendall-K1|Kendall-K1]] ([[User talk:Kendall-K1|talk]]) 22:24, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
:::To be honest I'm with you on that one, I've not looked for Ian yet but I'd imagine it's all tabloids which if that is the case then it's better not being included here at all, Thanks, ‚Äì[[User:Davey2010|&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;'''Davey'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;'''2010'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Davey2010|&lt;span style=&quot;color: navy;&quot;&gt;'''Talk'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:35, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
