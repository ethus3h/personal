~ Mission statement ~

The primary guild mission and philosophy is to foster a caring and friendly environment in Realm of the Mad God.

The guild is run by CuteFairy (me). If you need to contact me, you can email me at elliot@futuramerlin.com. The authoritative version of this document is maintained at https://github.com/ethus3h/personal/blob/master/Guild%20board.txt

~ Rules <3 ~

Be happy and cute and friendly!
Sign your comments on the guild board so we know who made them
Racism, sexism, harassment, homophobia/transphobia, "Gamer Gate" related activities, and other similar behaviors that are contrary to the guild's mission are strictly prohibited.
Note that this guild has a zero-tolerance policy towards sexual harassment. While this is covered by the previous rule, it has been an issue in the past and bears repeating.
Feel free to get in touch with me (CuteFairy) with any questions or concerns!
