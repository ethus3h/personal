\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 is a programming language first released at the end of 2015.
 It was originally concieved as a revision of the Perl programming language,
 but because it evolved during the course of its development (begun in 2000).
 It uses a specification and test-suite driven language development process,
 rather than an implementation-driven process.
 Consequently, there is not a single official implementation, although the
 Rakudo implementation is currently the most complete implementation available.
 It is a general purpose language that is just-in-time compiled to bytecode.
 The language is implemented using a subset language called NQP, which is
 run by a virtual machine.
 There are a few virtual machine implementations available, including a
 native one, one running on the Java Virtual Machine, and one for JavaScript.
 The native one,

, is the most complete of these.
 Perl 6 has many complex and capable programming constructs included with
 it.
 Consequently, it seems quite capable to me.
 The main detriment compared to other programming languages in general that
 it seems very module-centric, and that it is fairly a new language, and
 consequently that it does not have a substantial amount of documentation
 available for it.
 Another issue that bothers me specifically, is that it lacks strong facilities
 out of the box for use as a shell REPL environment and shell-style use
 for executing external shell commands and manipulating their output, although
 this is a problem shared by many languages that are not purpose-built as
 shell languages.
 The problem with being a module-centric language, exascerbated by it being
 a new language, is that packages for it are not available easily as native
 packages.
 This is also a common issue with languages that come with their own package
 managers, such as .NET's NuGet, Node.js's npm, and Python's pip.
 The consequence of this is that there is no significant pressure on package
 maintainers to keep their packages up to date and interoperable, because
 any given app only needs to work with one version of each package on which
 it depends.
 That system, however, breaks down when an app depends on two packages,
 each of which depend on a conflicting version of the same package, and
 one wants to avoid having outdated versions of the packages installed on
 one's system: the standard model of an elegant one-minor-version-per-package
 used by system package managers is broken, and rendered unable to ship
 the app properly.
