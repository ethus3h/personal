My first choice of language is Perl 6.
My second choice of language is COBOL.

Perl 6 is my first choice of language for two main reasons. First, Perl 6 has strong built-in support for implementing other languages, and I would like to learn to use this: I would like to implement a document format that I have been creating, and I think that knowing Perl 6 could help me with that. Second, Perl 6 has a number of features that I have heard about (and seem to have a lot of "buzz" and many popular applications), but don't have any significant understanding of the use of, or experience with: multiple dispatch, promises, asynchronous I/O, polymorphism, functional programming, introspection, generic programming, meta-object programming, and macros. That's certainly a lot of things to learn, so I'd pick a couple of areas to focus on.

My second language choice is COBOL, because it has a long history of being very capable for data processing work and file handling, and a lot of businesses seem to use it successfully. Because of that history of success with it, I think that it would be good to have experience with. (While C and Java have similar histories of successful use, I do not propose studying them as I have used them briefly.) I am also interested in learning about it because of how different it is from the languages I have experience using (as a file-processing language â€” Perl 6 is also quite different, because of its capacity for functional programming).
