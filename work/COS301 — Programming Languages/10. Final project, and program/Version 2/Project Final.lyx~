\begin_layout Abstract
This article introduces and summarizes the Perl 6 programming language and
 some of its various features and capabilities, as well as discussing its
 applications, effective uses, popularity, prospects, and limitations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Part 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My first choice of language is Perl 6.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My second choice of language is COBOL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 is my first choice of language for two main reasons.
 First, Perl 6 has strong built-in support for implementing other languages,
 and I would like to learn to use this: I would like to implement a document
 format that I have been developing, and I think that knowing Perl 6 Grammars
 could help me with that.
 While Perl 6 reportedly has issues with performance, and may not be an
 appropriate long-term choice for implementing the format, it seems like
 it would be excellent for rapid prototyping and iterative development of
 the format.
 Second, Perl 6 has a number of features that I have heard about, that seem
 to have a lot of "buzz", and that seem to have wide applicability and popular
 use, but that I don't have any significant experience with or understanding
 of the use of: multiple dispatch, promises, asynchronous I/O, polymorphism,
 functional programming, introspection, generic programming, meta-object
 programming, and macros.
 Because that would be a lot of things to learn in only a semester, I would
 presumably select a few areas to focus on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My second language choice is COBOL, because it has a long history of being
 very capable for data processing work and file handling, and a lot of businesse
s seem to use it successfully.
 Because of that history of success with it, I think that it would be good
 to have experience with.
 (While C and Java have similar histories of successful use, I do not propose
 studying them as I have used them briefly.) I am also interested in learning
 about COBOL because, as a file processing and business language, it is
 quite different from the languages I have experience using.
 (Perl 6 is also quite different, because of its capacity for functional
 programming.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For reference, the languages with which I have the most confidence and experienc
e in are, in roughly descending order:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bash (along with PHP, which is a reasonably close second, I have by far
 the most confidence and experience in Bash, and generally find it enjoyable
 to use)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PHP 5 (I used it a lot until I switched to writing most things in Bash)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
C (don't have a lot of experience with it, only having written small patches,
 but I've appreciated the readability of it in working with others’ code)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Python (All the apps I wrote in Python that I still use I have since re-written
 in Bash, and found it much more appropriate for them)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
C# (mostly from doing game programming in Unity using Microsoft Visual Studio
 for a class)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Perl (used it for one tiny project about eight years ago, but don't remember
 anything about it really)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Java (I don't really get it, and found it frustrating when I tried it)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
C++ (poked around briefly trying to patch a couple of apps in it, no real
 understanding)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Part 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 is a programming language first released at the end of 2015.
 It was originally conceived as a revision of the Perl programming language,
 but because it evolved during the course of its development (begun in 2000),
 it was split from the older language, which will continue to be maintained
 separately.
 It uses a specification and test-suite driven language development process,
 rather than an implementation-driven process.
 Consequently, there is not a single official implementation, although the
 Rakudo implementation is currently the most complete implementation available,
 and is the only implementation that is currently available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 is a general purpose language that by default for modules is just-in-time
 compiled to bytecode, and for scripts is interpreted, although this can
 be changed.
 The language is implemented using a subset language called NQP, which is
 run by a virtual machine.
 There are a few virtual machine implementations available, including a
 native one, one running on the Java Virtual Machine, and one for JavaScript.
 The native one, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

MoarVM
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is the most complete of these, in that it has support for the most language
 features of the various implementations.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "project"

\end_inset

 Perl 6 has many complex and capable programming constructs included with
 it.
 Because of this, it seems quite capable to me.
 The main detriment compared to other programming languages in general that
 it seems very module-centric, and that it is fairly a new language, and
 consequently that it does not have a substantial amount of documentation
 available for it.
 Another issue that bothers me specifically, is that it lacks strong facilities
 out of the box for use as a shell REPL environment and shell-style use
 for executing external shell commands and manipulating their output, although
 this is a problem shared by many languages that are not purpose-built as
 shell languages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 is a module-centric language, including its own package management
 and package repository.
 One problem caused by it being a module-centric language, exacerbated by
 it being a new language, is that packages for it are not available easily
 as native packages.
 This is also a common issue with languages that come with their own package
 managers, such as .NET's NuGet, Node.js's npm, and Python's pip.
 There are several other issues caused by languages using their own package
 managers, as well.
 Another major consequence of this is that there is no significant pressure
 on package maintainers to keep their packages up to date and interoperable,
 because any given app only needs to work with one version of each package
 on which it depends.
 That system, however, breaks down when an app depends on two packages,
 each of which depend on a conflicting version of the same package, and
 one wants to avoid having outdated versions of the packages installed on
 one's system: the standard model of an elegant one-minor-version-per-package
 used by system package managers is broken, and rendered unable to ship
 the app properly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While being a new language could conceivably be a problem because of a lack
 of available libraries for a language, this problem is avoided by Perl
 6 by including a system for interacting with

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Perl 6 contains a wide range of capabilities and features.
 The feature that interested me the most is grammars.
 That is what made me choose to pursue learning about the language.
 Perl 6's grammars allow writing code that parses a language and returns
 an abstract syntax tree without having to manually write the parser: rather,
 one can write a set of rules that combine to express the syntax of the
 language.
 This provides a powerful facility for being able to handle problems of
 implementing languages and document formats, and consequently is something
 that interests me, as I have a document format that I would like to implement.
 The rules in Perl 6 are created using 
\emph on
patterns
\emph default
, which are somewhat similar to regular expressions in other languages,
 and generally take their place in Perl 6, although Perl 5–style regular
 expressions are still available in Perl 6 in case they are needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these abilities, Perl 6 has many other features, as well,
 that contribute to it being effective and capable at solving a variety
 of other problems: rather than focusing exclusively on one problem domain
 at the expense of facility in others, it is a general-purpose language
 that provides a range of tools that can be used, combined, and adapted
 for various applications.

 Its mascot is a butterfly named Camelia 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 It integrates several techniques different from the way Perl works, such
 as using lazy evaluation.
 This creates some changes in the way the language operates compared to
 Perl, and consequently it is somewhat different, with some language constructs
 not being available in Perl 6, thus necessitating working around their
 absence.
 For example, the 
\family typewriter
wantsarray
\family default
 construct from Perl is apparently not available in Perl 6, according to
 the language FAQ 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "P6FAQ"

\end_inset

.
 My lack of familiarity with Perl prevents my assessing thoroughly the extent
 of a problem that this causes.
 Perl 6 uses (limited-precision 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "News"

\end_inset

) rational numbers by default, rather than floating point, so that decimals
 will follow the traditional rules of arithmetic rather than the slightly
 strange behavior of floating-point numbers (floating-point numbers will
 produce unexpected results in some cases when doing arithmetic on them
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Overflow"

\end_inset

), but at the cost of performance.
 Floating-point numbers can be used if they are desired, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 
\emph on
grammars
\emph default
 are an extremely expressive tool for writing parsers for languages and
 document formats.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Documentation"

\end_inset

 They are a way to specify the syntax of a language in such a way that given
 a grammar and a string to parse using it, the Perl 6 language can build
 an abstract syntax tree that can be used by code generators for compiling
 a language, or by other tools that can work with abstract syntax trees.
 A grammar is a set of patterns (which can be named, and reference each
 other) using which the input string is parsed.
 A Perl 6 grammar is a class, so it can be used as other classes.
 To allow better expressivity from grammars, 
\emph on
actions
\emph default
 are available (a type of class that allows the parse process to call its
 methods).
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Documentation_2"

\end_inset

 This allows hooking into the parse process with other code, to allow a
 wide range of uses outside the traditional scope of grammars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 seems to have good prospects ahead of it, being a new language.
 Now that it has been released, it will presumably see extensive testing,
 and consequent development, due to its being in more widespread use.
 In summary, it is a capable and flexible general-purpose language that,
 while being new and having some rough edges, is quite capable and useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Part 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Basic syntactic structure, including statement terminators or separators,
 block structure, syntactic peculiarities, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Perl 6, blocks are typically denoted by braces (
\family typewriter
{
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
}
\family default
) and can be nested.
 Statements are delimited by semicolons (
\family typewriter
;
\family default
), but the semicolons can be omitted in some circumstances, when the end
 of a statement is unambiguous.
 A block can be preceded by 
\family typewriter
-‌>
\family default
, with an interceding list of variables, called a 
\emph on
pointy block
\emph default
, which acts similarly to an anonymous function.
 Parentheses can be used to denote semantic divisions within a given block.
 Perl 6 has five types of variables, denoted by one of four indicators called
 
\emph on
sigils
\emph default
, or by the absence of a sigil; these determine the default type of the
 variable, affect how assignment to the variable takes place, and possibly
 introduce a type constraint on the variable

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The units or levels of scope and the nature and type (runtime or compile-time)
 of name bindings within the different levels of scope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the scope of variables in Perl 6 is determined by the 
\emph on
declarator
\emph default
 with which the variable was declared (most commonly 
\family typewriter
my
\family default
).
 Perl 6 uses a variety of modifiers, called 
\emph on
twigils
\emph default
, to alter the default scoping 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Documentation"

\end_inset

.
 There are seven declarators and two declarator-style prefixes, and there
 are nine twigils (not counting the absence of a twigil)

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Primitive data types available, including range limitations or lack thereof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of the 260 built-in types in Perl 6, 47 of them are primitive types.
 All types are subtypes of

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Things that can be numbers are subtypes of 
\family typewriter

\family default
.
 Common number types are 
\family typewriter
Int
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Num
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
Rat
\family default
.
 
\family typewriter
Int
\family default
s do not restrict the range of values they can hold, beyond only accepting
 integers.
 
\family typewriter
Num
\family default
s usually hold either

 value, 
\family typewriter
Inf
\family default
 (infinity, or a number too large to store in a 
\family typewriter
Num
\family default
), or 
\family typewriter
NaN
\family default
 (not a number).
 
\family typewriter
Rat
\family default
s are rational numbers, so they do not accumulate errors like floating-point
 numbers (in Perl 6, 
\family typewriter
Num
\family default
s) do.
 Their denominators are limited to 64 bits.
 If one desires a 
\family typewriter
Rat
\family default
 that does not have a restriction on the values of its numerator and denominator
, a 
\family typewriter
FatRat
\family default
 can be used instead.
 In addition, the 
\family typewriter
Real
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Complex
\family default
 types are available.
 A 
\family typewriter
Real
\family default
 can be created from the non-imaginary numeric types, and a 
\family typewriter
Complex
\family default
 can be created from two 
\family typewriter
Real
\family default
s representing the number's real and imaginary parts

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Operators for primitive data types and their precedence and associativity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 has twenty-seven levels of precedence.
 All operators can be written as subroutines 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Documentation"

\end_inset

.
 Custom operators are allowed, and can have their precedence specified relative
 to the built-in operators.
 Most operators can be overloaded.
 There are three types of associativity for unary operators: left-associative,
 right-associative, and non-associative.
 Binary operators add to these three chain-associative and list-associative.
 The position of operators relative to their operand(s) has five categories:
 prefix (preceding the operand), infix (between two operands), postfix (succedin
g the operand), circumfix (surrounding the operand — `bracketing' operators),
 and postcircumfix (bracketing the second of two operands).
 These five categories, combined with the operator, can be written as subroutine
s, as in this example from the documentation: 
\family typewriter
circumfix:«[ ]»(<a b c>)
\family default
, being equivalent to 
\family typewriter
[<a b c>]
\family default
.
 Some operators can be created by combining other operators together, such
 as type coersion and assignment (
\family typewriter
~
\family default
 coerces to a string, and 
\family typewriter
=
\family default
 assigns; combined, 
\family typewriter
~=
\family default
 coerces the right operand to a string and assigns it to the left operand).
 There are also the 
\family typewriter
s///
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
S///
\family default
 substitution operators, but the documentation is, as far as I could tell,
 unclear on which of the above types of operator they fall into, and does
 not state clearly whether the regular rules that apply to operators apply
 to them.

Part 4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
1.
 Data types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 includes a large amount of non-primitive types in the language itself:
 33 compound types, 56 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

domain-specific
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 types, and 113 exception types.
 This includes common compound types such as arrays, lists, and hashes,
 as well as various other types for a range of applications, such as for
 documentation, concurrent programming, and I/O for various operating systems.
 Perl 6 includes a large amount of capabilities within the language core
 itself.
 That allows the base language installation to be quite functional.
 It means that it is not necessary to install as many additional libraries
 to have a practical base of tools

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
2.
 Standard library
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 does not itself have a specified standard library 
\emph on
per se
\emph default
, but the Rakudo Star distribution (the primary way to obtain an implementation
 of the language) does include a variety of additional 
\emph on
modules
\emph default
 (46 of them) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "New1"

\end_inset

.
 Rakudo Star includes tools for performance debugging and profiling, such
 as 
\family typewriter
debugger-ui-commandline
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
grammar-debugger
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Grammar-Profiler-Simple
\family default
.
 It provides the 
\family typewriter
Terminal-ANSIColor
\family default
 module for creating colored output from command-line programs, and 
\family typewriter
test-mock
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Test-META
\family default
 for creating unit tests.
 Rakudo Star provides tools for data interchange and serialization, in the
 form of seven modules for working with JSON, and one for XML, as well as
 a database interface module (
\family typewriter
DBIlish
\family default
).
 For graphics, Rakudo Star comes with the 
\family typewriter
svg
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
svg-plot
\family default
 modules.
 It also includes several such as 
\family typewriter
perl6-http-easy
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
perl6-http-status
\family default
 for network interoperation.
 Perl 6 includes a package manager module, also, called 
\family typewriter
zef
\family default
, which provides a command-line interface for managing the packages installed
 in a system

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
3.
 Semantics of expression evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 makes a distinction between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

statements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

expressions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Expressions in Perl 6 are statements that return a value.
 A program in Perl 6 semantically represents a list of statements (things
 for the computer to do).
 To make a statement act as an expression, the 
\family typewriter
do
\family default
 keyword can be used, which will cause the statement given to represent
 its value in the given context.
 Perl 6 generally evaluates statements in the order in which they are presented
 in the program (following the natural control flow), although internally
 it will divide up statements to be run concurrently in multiple threads
 if the result is the same

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
4.
 Type coercion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, Perl 6 when encountering a variable that does not have a specified
 type will convert it to the necessary type when it is used in a context
 where its current type is not applicable.
 To override this behavior, types can be specified for each object, allowing
 strict type checking.
 When a specific type is requested for a variable, assignments to that variable
 will not be coerced, and explicit casting is required 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Documentation"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
5.
 Semantics of assignment statements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 has complex assignment semantics, similar to Java, because it uses
 containers for some values, but values can also exist without containers.
 Containers are object-oriented wrappers around the native (native to the
 Perl 6 virtual machine) types.
 The documentation writes that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The assignment operator asks the container on the left to store the value
 on its right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Documentation"

\end_inset

.
 Because of this, the actual effect of assigning a value to a name depends
 on the type of container that has been created by variable declaration.
 In practice, this is largely transparent to the user, and the context of
 a reference to a variable will affect whether the container is used or
 the value within the container is used.
 If the user wants control over this, the language provides some constructs
 for controlling these issues 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Documentation"

\end_inset

, but in my experience the defaults have generally worked well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A list can contain containers or values.
 Because of this, it is not always possible to assign to list elements,
 because lists are immutable and values cannot be changed.
 However, if the items in a list are containers, they can be changed because
 the container itself will stay the same.
 That is because the containers themselves do not change; rather, what they
 point to changes.
 Unlike lists, arrays only hold containers.
 Consequently, their contents can be changed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Part 5: Control constructs and subprograms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Control flow constructs in Perl 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perl 6 control flow takes the form of statements.
 Statements can be grouped into blocks using braces.
 A block can be treated as a statement, used alone on a logical line, in
 which case it will be executed, or it can be used as a literal anonymous
 subprogram.
 Keywords can be used to guide a program's control flow.
 In contexts where it would usually be treated as a literal, it can be prefaced
 with the 
\family typewriter
do
\family default
 keyword to execute it instead.
 For conditional branching, 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
 can be used instead, which uses a condition to determine whether to execute
 a given block.
 Along with 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
else
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
elsif
\family default
 can be used to select other blocks to execute.
 There is also 
\family typewriter
unless
\family default
, which acts similar to 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
 with the condition inverted.
 For testing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

, the 
\family typewriter
with
\family default

\family typewriter
orwith
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
without
\family default
 statements can be used, corresponding to the 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
elsif
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
unless
\family default
 statements, respectively.
 
\family typewriter
when
\family default
 is similar to 
\family typewriter
if
\family default
, but exits the enclosing block, and does not resume with it after the selected
 block finishes.
 With the 
\family typewriter
when
\family default
 keyword, the 
\family typewriter
default
\family default
 keyword can be used to construct multi-way branches similar to a C switch
 statement.
 This is often done using the 
\family typewriter
given
\family default
 statement, which can be used to select a topic variable for 
\family typewriter
when
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

 and

, the

 only be executed once.
 The

\family typewriter

 keywords can be used to continue the loop without finishing the current
 iteration, to leave the loop without finishing the current iteration, and
 to start the current iteration of the loop body again.
 To return from a block, the 
\family typewriter
return
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
return-rw
\family default
 keywords can be used (
\family typewriter

 gives a mutable result).
 Within a block, the

fail
\family default
 keyword can be used to throw an exception.
 Additionally,

 can be used to restrict execution of subsets of a program to certain contexts,
 such as the

 phaser for when an exception is thrown, or various phasers for important
 points within a program such as entering and leaving blocks.

Subprograms in Perl 6
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Perl 6, subprograms are declared using the 
\family typewriter
sub
\family default
 keyword.
 For anonymous functions, a literal inline block is more concise in some
 contexts.
 To indicate that multiple dispatch should be allowed for a named subprogram,
 it must be declared with the 
\family typewriter
multi
\family default
 keyword.
 The 
\family typewriter
proto
\family default
 keyword can be used to specify a template for type signatures that all
 the 
\family typewriter
multi
\family default
 subprograms sharing that name must match.
 Subprograms can be used as operators, or as 
\emph on
traits
\emph default
, which

.
 Perl 6 also provides tools for re-dispatching, which is giving another
 subprogram the same arguments the current one was called with.
