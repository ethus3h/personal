- Feedback integration
  - "think about how to bring the reader early on into getting the concept of the project. I think you do it relatively well but you should help your reader by bringing strong/concrete examples from the onset. Also adding some figures would help. The text just feels a little bit too “dry” and technical. You can start with making it more digestable, and then in later sections you can go towards more technical stuff. You *do it* already but … just not enough."
  - concrete examples. Make accessible description. Write in a way that assumes no audience foreknowledge of the project. Accessible slides. Explain what i do before how i do it which is less interesting. Interest them, give a hook. Make them want to understand. Start with concrete example(s). For the event thing, let ppl write code. Type-in StageL code to demo it & let people experience it, like an old computer magazine. Adjust Gantt chart and discuss how I am late. Ask for advice from jon's class what i could cut or do to make it work.
  - First, extplain what we are doing very simply. Then explian wwhy we're doing it, which can be more intellecutaly.
  - Add user stories / use cases.
