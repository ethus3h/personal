  - "think about how to bring the reader early on into getting the concept of the project. I think you do it relatively well but you should help your reader by bringing strong/concrete examples from the onset. Also adding some figures would help. The text just feels a little bit too “dry” and technical. You can start with making it more digestable, and then in later sections you can go towards more technical stuff. You *do it* already but … just not enough."

- Due : Assignment 30 Seconds Text Animation text to sound (use until?)Kinetic Typography Assignment: Please create a 30-second kinetic typography piece (slightly longer is okay) utilizing only typefaces, color design, and simple shape elements (think lines and squares, not clip art/photos). The piece can be animated to music, podcasts, television, film quotes, or any other form of audio you wish to use. The key word in this assignment is 'kinetic'. Animations should be dynamic and appropriate to the subject material. Your design choices should reinforce the atmosphere/content of the audio clip you use. You are welcome to use 3D layers, AE expressions, scale, position, rotation, and AE effects to obtain your desired results. This assignment is due on October 11th, when we will have critique.
