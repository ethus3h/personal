  - "This project should aim to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living, and to ensure the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment.": "Once again: bring a few examples of how this would all work."
  - "think about how to bring the reader early on into getting the concept of the project. I think you do it relatively well but you should help your reader by bringing strong/concrete examples from the onset. Also adding some figures would help. The text just feels a little bit too “dry” and technical. You can start with making it more digestable, and then in later sections you can go towards more technical stuff. You *do it* already but … just not enough."
