    Week 1: 

    Install Unity and do these 4 tutorials (about 5 minutes each) https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/interactive-tutorials. Deposit on the Blackboard screen captures of the “done” page of each tutorial (4 of them, NOT the whole game folder). Also I suggest watching the Live Training: Prototyping standard assets (1:00:15) to get a feel for what is available in the Standard Assets.
