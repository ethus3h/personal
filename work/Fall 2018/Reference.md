Based on the definitions set out in the “Design Approaches” badge, post a diagram to your channel in Slack that shows how the technical parts of your project will work together. For a piece accessed via typical setups such as a mobile phone or browser, you can focus on software parts (eg, database, server scripts, Web pages). For a custom installation or wearable, be sure to include hardware components (eg, sensor, Arduino, laptop, projector). Use a design application that makes it easy to revise your diagram, eg Illustrator or Omnigraffle rather than Photoshop.*Get Ganttproject*
Download and install Ganttproject in advance on the laptop you bring to class. We will review the software in class, but you may draft your timeline in Ganttproject in anticipation if you want to get ahead of the curve.
