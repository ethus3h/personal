# Abstract


"Ember" is the current working name for a project to develop and facilitate collaboration on a specification, a computing environment, a library, and a model community, to serve as resources and infrastructure for innovative communities.

The primary components comprising the project are currently unfinished, but a variety of software maintained to facilitate the development of the project is available.

# The problem(Cite at least three sources to support that it is a problem)

# Three existing projects that come closest to solving

# General approach, and its alignment to my and others' definitions of new media.

## Alignment of the approach to my and others' definitions of new media.

# Features of my proposed solution, in detail

# Expected outcomes

- Completed, stable software environment used for developing the project
- Project objectives completed
  - Support and ongoing development of the project's intellectual deliverables
    - Computing environment

  - Active development and ongoing support of a computing environment embodying the principles of the project

# Tasks list (at least twenty specific items)

## Planning and strategy
- The most important tasks are also the most difficult. Developing assets (specifications, software, etc.) is trivial compared to developing communication skills and building allies. There's a reason there are several usable computer programs developed for this project, but no other people working on it.

## People and communication
- Establish connections with people. Human connections will be critical for the success of this project.
- Develop effective communication skills and strategies. Without being able to get allies in developing the project, it would be dead in the water.
  - That means being able to express clearly, succinctly, and persuasively the following (at least): _what_ this project is, _why_ it is important and achievable, and _how_ to help with it.
  - This includes both in writing and in person. My in-person speaking on it is particularly disastrously bad.

## Finances, budget, and stability
- Finances: Develop a financial strategy and budget requirements. As a single, close to broke student without employment, a degree (yet), or a rich family giving me a small loan of a million dollars, I can barely support keeping the lights on for the Web site. (Hosting is going to expire in October, and I haven't figured out how I'm going to pay for it for the next few years. It's somewhere in the US$5/month range. The domain name registration is good through the end of 2022, at which point it will need renewal, which is about US$10/year.)
- While the project still has a bus factor of 1, my personal stability is critical for the project. Barring exceptional circumstances, I should be able to continue working on it through graduation thanks to the university and government's student financial aid, and my family's financial support.

## Steps dependent on interpersonal connections
- Establish the physical community. This will require *at least* tens of thousands of US dollars.
- Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project
- Ensure that organization's financial stability (through sources such as an endowment and grants)
- Transfer control of the project's assets (Web presence, etc.) to that organization
