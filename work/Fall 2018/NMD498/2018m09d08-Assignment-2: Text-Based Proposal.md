# Abstract

This proposal suggests a project to develop and facilitate collaboration on a specification, a computing environment, a library, and a model community, to serve as resources and infrastructure for innovative communities.

# The problem

There is no project to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living. This results in wasted effort on developing redundant proprietary technologies, regressions in standards of living caused by the unavailability of proprietary systems, and the incalculable loss of shared cultural heritage through inconsistent or nonexistent archival practices (and in many cases active hostility towards historical preservation, especially in the interest of short-term personal economic gain).

There is also no project to ensure the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. This results in human suffering and inequality, catastrophic cultural and historical loss, and prolonged global ecological crises caused by government and corporate apathy and abuse.

These problems are not hypothetical. They are very real and ongoing problems, and are actively causing very real and ongoing harm.

# General approach

This project should aim to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living, and to ensure the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. The communites should attempt to provide a consistent and complete experience to the people who are part of them, without depending on support from external infrastructure, technology, or government. Relying on external support increases fragility. 

To organize the broad scope of this project, it is currently divided into four primary areas of work: 
- A specification of principles and methods on which the project is based
- A community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project
- An information technology environment
- A library of knowledge and great cultural works

## Current project status

"Ember" is the current name of this project.

The primary components comprising the project are currently unfinished, but a variety of software maintained to facilitate the development of the project is available.

The main output of the project so far has been the successful development of two well-tested, partially completed software applications that are currently used to facilitate the further development of the project. The first of these is a static Web site generator, which is used to build the project's Web site (it includes working features for theming using CSS, with some included themes, automatic blog pagination, and discography Web site generation for musicians). The second of these is a suite of tools for working with file version tracking, document archiving, and data storage and distribution. It is currently in use for storing and managing the more than eleven million files and forty version control repositories used now for the project, as well as the structured archiving of more than eighteen million additional documents outside of the project.

# Expected outcomes

- Completed, stable software environment used for developing the project
- Project objectives completed
  - Support and ongoing development of the project's intellectual deliverables, all of which (with the exceptions of parts 2 and 3 of the library) should be libre-licensed
    - Specifications
      - Philosophy and rationale
      - Community
      - Technology and engineering
    - Information technology environment software implementation
    - Library of knowledge and great cultural works
  - A self-sustaining financially, technologically, and resource-independent community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project, and to serve as a model for other communities using this strategy
    - Managed, geographically-redundant computing infrastructure and data archival
  - Distribution of the knowledge assets, allowing a decentralized network of communities using these specifications
    - Ideally, the entirety of the knowledge assets (perhaps excluding section 3 of the library) would be available in a wristband storage format, or something similar, ensuring that every person carries the entirety of the contents of the project with them, essentially becoming human backups of the data, and with any single person having the knowledge necessary to recreate the entire project and all its technology if they want. Printed books should also be available and distributed to libraries.
    - The cloud computing infrastructure should use a decentralized, asynchronously resolving append-only data store, similar to blockchains, to ensure the preservation and longevity of data stored using it as best as possible.

# Tasks list

## Planning and strategy
- The most important tasks are also the most difficult. Developing assets (specifications, software, etc.) is trivial compared to developing communication skills and establishing allies. There's a reason there are several usable computer programs developed for this project, but no other people working on it.
- My role in this project should be to coordinate and facilitate until a person or persons more capable is/are available, and/or until it is self-managed, and my presence or absence would have no appreciable effect on it.

## People and communication
- Establish connections with people. Human connections will be critical for the success of this project.
- Develop effective communication skills and strategies. Without being able to get allies in developing the project, it would be dead in the water.
  - That means being able to express clearly, succinctly, and persuasively the following (at least): _what_ this project is, _why_ it is important and achievable, and _how_ to help with it.
  - This includes both in writing and in person. My in-person speaking on it is particularly disastrously bad.

## Finances, budget, and stability
- Finances: Develop a financial strategy and budget requirements. As a single, close to broke student without employment, a degree (yet), or a rich family giving me a small loan of a million dollars, I can barely support keeping the lights on for the Web site. (Hosting is going to expire in October, and I haven't figured out how I'm going to pay for it for the next few years. It's somewhere in the US$5/month range. The domain name registration is good through the end of 2022, at which point it will need renewal, which is about US$10/year.)
- While the project still has a bus factor of 1, my personal stability is critical for the project. Barring exceptional circumstances, I should be able to continue working on it through graduation thanks to the university and government's student financial aid, and my family's financial support.

## Steps dependent on interpersonal connections
- Establish the physical community. This will require initial capital of *at least* tens of thousands of US dollars, as well as support for ongoing expenses.
- Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project
- Ensure that organization's financial stability (through sources such as an endowment and grants)
- Transfer control of the project's assets (Web presence, etc.) to that organization 

## Development

These tasks are much less important than the above, but are much easier and comprehensible for me. Consequently, this is where most of my work so far has been.

- Develop, write, test, and document specifications
  - Community governance specifications
  - Technology information and specifications (engineering, construction, information technology, etc.), without dependencies (enough information should be included to enable full construction of all technologies starting from nature, without any existing knowledge or technology/machinery; this should be _tested_)
- Continue development of support software
- Develop software for information technology environment (EITE)
  - Finish specifying and implement portable, trivial staging language (StageL)
  - Port existing EITE implementation to StageL
  - Provide and implement StageL inside EITE
  - Get text rendering implemented in EITE
  - UI widgets
  - Implement simple document editor in EITE
  - Complex text rendering support
  - Other EITE development tasks: networking, data storage and distribution, etc.
- Write/compile the library
  - Write, compile, and organize content for part 1 of the library
    - Specifications (from above)
    - Subject area information (history, mathematics, linguistics, engineering, etc.)
  - Continue compiling part 2 of the library
- (Dependent on additional finances, land, and people) Provide physical cloud computing infrastructure
- Figure out how to connect the community's network to the Internet, somehow (it shouldn't be dependent on external parties: it should follow the Internet Archive's model of being an AS with peering agreements) to allow accessing and preserving the knowledge there

# Features of the proposed solution, in detail

# Alignment of the project approach to the traits of the currently emerging new media

Henry Jenkins's article "Eight Traits of the New Media Landscape" (http://nmdprojects.net/teaching_resources/jenkins_eight_traits_of_new_media.pdf) provides eight traits that its author observes in the prominent currently emerging new media. This section of the proposal evaluates this project's expression of this set of traits.

The first of these traits is _innovation_. As a communication medium, the information technology environment aspect of this project proposal is arguably merely an extension and refinement of existing communication media. However, because those existing media are themselves innovative, this project remains a work within new media, even if it is not itself a new medium.

The second trait is _convergence_. This proposal is highly convergent, being a broadly scoped project to innovate across a wide range of aspects of society, industry, and technology. Even regarding only the information technology environment, it is intended to inherit the capabilities of existing computers, which are used for text, sound, image, video, and interactive media, among others.

The third defining trait is _everyday_ presence. As a project to develop a unified system providing all the knowledge resources needed for running a society, if it is successfully completed and used to its envisioned potential, it would serve as the framework for people's everyday lives. When only available in partial form, those portions of it can be used in everyday settings as well (e.g. large chunks of my classwork and other data I rely on and use on an everyday basis (personal projects, music library, email, etc.) are stored and managed using software developed in the course of developing this project).

The fourth trait is _appropriation_. This proposed project ideally will be highly appropriative, because so much work has already been done. It would in all probability be hugely wasteful and impractical to attempt to build everything from scratch, rather than to leverage existing systems (even if only practical through inspiration!) and merely work to fill gaps and integrate the various existing technologies well. That said, reliance on proprietary or externally managed technologies should be eliminated as soon as practical, with all elements of the project and its dependencies being fully libre, because proprietary, non-maintainable, and trade-dependent systems are brittle and are a huge threat to the ability of human society to maintain its standards of living over time.

The fifth trait is _networkedness_. As a design goal for this project, networking should be provided when available, but never mandatory. Systems that depend entirely on networking are, echoing the discussion of the fourth point, brittle. A cloud computing–backed virtual digital assistant, for instance, is thoroughly useless in the event of networking being unavailable. Once constructed, the best tools would be fully usable in a vacuum.

The sixth trait is being _global_. The proposed project is intended to be able to be geographically dispersed, although individual communities would only be able to collaborate on physical projects by being physically colocated, for obvious reasons.

The seventh trait is _generational_. Whether an age gap will affect this project is hard to predict. If it does, it should only be by the choice of individuals, rather than by inaccessibility or prejudice: if people who are a different age than the majority involved in the project, those people should be provided any necessary accommodations to the fullest extent possible (medical care for the elderly, education for the young, and so on). This project should not engage in discrimination based on age, although for the time being probably only adults would be practical for this project to serve, in the interest of ensuring the presence of a sufficient child protection framework (e.g. I think Google doesn't allow kids to use it, so this presumably shouldn't either).

The eighth trait is _inequality_. Unfortunately, this likely may affect the project initially, because a community would presumably be unable to sufficiently support individuals with some disabilities to modern standards until it was somewhat technologically sophisticated, meaning that people involved in the project would need to be able to provide for themselves and (for the physical community or communities) provide transportation for access, restricting practical use of the project to those who are wealthy or otherwise supported. Working to reduce undesired inequality as much as possible should be a design goal of the project, while promoting diversity and freedom.
