# Abstract

This proposal introduces a project to develop and facilitate collaboration on a specification, a computing environment, a library, and a model community, to serve as resources and infrastructure for innovative communities.

# The problem

There is no project that is successfully systematically supporting the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living. "Libre" refers to the ethical principle of freedom of knowledge, whereby knowledge is provided with the legal protection of rights such as modification and redistribution. (For specifics on this project's goals and strategies in libre licensing, see the "Licensing" section below.) This results in wasted effort on developing redundant proprietary technologies (for instance, multiple non-interoperable word processing apps), regressions in standards of living caused by the unavailability of proprietary systems (for instance, not being able to use the features of a previous version of a word processing app that some capabilities removed), and the incalculable loss of shared cultural heritage through inconsistent or nonexistent archival practices (and in many cases active hostility towards historical preservation, especially in the interest of short-term personal economic gain) (for instance, the loss of many historic films and television series to neglect or deliberate destruction).

There is also no project that is successfully ensuring the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. This results in human suffering and inequality (for instance, the dramatic disparities in income between race, gender, and economic groups), catastrophic cultural and historical loss (for instance, as in the loss of the National Museum of Brazil), and prolonged global ecological crises (for instance, deforestation and climate change) caused by government and corporate apathy and abuse.

These problems are not hypothetical. They are very real and ongoing problems, and are actively causing very real and ongoing harm.

## Evidence of the problem

For an annotated reading list of evidence supporting the presence of some of the issues this project tackles, see the "Evidence of the problem" section of the bibliography at the end of this proposal.

## Existing work towards solving this problem

Many existing projects address various aspects of the issues this project addresses. None seems to cohesively aim to integrate these aspects into a comprehensive libre framework and model implementation, though, driving the need for this project. For an annotated list of related projects and inspirations to this project, see the "Related projects and inspirations" section of the bibliography at the end of this proposal.

# General approach

This project should aim to systematically support the libre development and distribution as best as possible of the full set of knowledge and resources needed to support humans' standard of living, and to ensure the availability of communities managed in the long-term interest of their constituents, humanity, and the environment. The communities should attempt to provide a consistent and complete experience to the people who are part of them, without depending on support from external infrastructure, technology, or government. Relying on external support increases fragility.

This is a multifaceted project to develop a scalable environment for building an effective, just, and efficient society; consequently, it is quite broad in scope. To organize the broad scope of this project, it is currently divided into four primary areas of work: 
- A specification of principles and methods on which the project is based
- A community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project
- An information technology environment
- A library of knowledge and great cultural works

## Current project status

"Ember" is the current name of this project.

The primary components comprising the project are currently unfinished, but a variety of software maintained to facilitate the development of the project is available.

The main output of the project so far has been the successful development of two well-tested, partially completed software applications that are currently used to facilitate the further development of the project. The first of these is a static Web site generator, which is used to build the project's Web site (it includes working features for theming using CSS, with some included themes, automatic blog pagination, and discography Web site generation for musicians). The second of these is a suite of tools for working with file version tracking, document archiving, and data storage and distribution. It is currently in use for storing and managing the more than eleven million files and forty version control repositories used now for the project, as well as the structured archiving of more than eighteen million additional documents outside of the project.

Other parts of the project are also begun. (The technical specifications and other data produced so far for the project are not included in this proposal document.)

# Expected outcomes

- Completed, stable software environment used for developing the project
- Project objectives completed
  - Support and ongoing development of the project's intellectual deliverables, all of which (with the exceptions of parts 2 and 3 of the library) should be libre-licensed
    - Specifications
      - Philosophy and rationale
      - Community
      - Technology and engineering
      - Goods and services
    - Information technology environment software implementation
    - Library of knowledge and great cultural works
  - A self-sustaining financially, technologically, and resource-independent community and a non-profit organization to manage and implement the project, and to serve as a model for other communities using this strategy
    - Managed, geographically-redundant computing infrastructure and data archiving
  - Distribution of the knowledge assets, allowing a decentralized network of communities using these specifications
    - Ideally, the entirety of the knowledge assets (perhaps excluding section 3 of the library) would be available in a wristband storage format, or something similar, ensuring that every person carries the entirety of the contents of the project with them, essentially becoming human backups of the data, and with any single person having the knowledge necessary to recreate the entire project and all its technology if they want. Printed books should also be available and distributed to libraries.
    - The cloud computing infrastructure should use a decentralized, asynchronously resolving append-only data store, similar to blockchains, to ensure the preservation and longevity of data stored using it as best as possible.

# Tasks list

## Planning and strategy
- The most important tasks are also the most difficult. Developing assets (specifications, software, etc.) is trivial compared to developing communication skills and establishing allies. There's a reason there are several usable computer programs developed for this project, but no other people working on it.
- My role in this project should be to coordinate and facilitate until a person or persons more capable is/are available, and/or until it is self-managed, and my presence or absence would have no appreciable effect on it.

## People and communication
- Establish connections with people. Human connections will be critical for the success of this project.
- Develop effective communication skills and strategies. Without being able to get allies in developing the project, it would be dead in the water.
  - That means being able to express clearly, succinctly, and persuasively the following (at least): _what_ this project is, _why_ it is important and achievable, and _how_ to help with it.
  - This includes both in writing and in person. Improving my in-person communication skills is especially important (my in-person speaking on this project is disastrously bad).

## Finances, budget, and stability
- Finances: Develop a financial strategy and budget requirements. As a single, close to broke student without employment or a degree (yet), or a rich family giving me a small loan of a million dollars, I can barely support keeping the lights on for the Web site. (Hosting is going to expire in October, and I haven't figured out how I'm going to pay for it for the next few years. It's somewhere in the US$5/month range. The domain name registration (`futuramerlin.com`) is good through the end of 2022, at which point it will need renewal, which is about US$10/year.) The most recent costs of technical infrastructure is US$106.20 for three years of Web hosting, plus US$83.76 for eight year ownership of domain name. A rough estimate of the cost for the semester of Web hosting is therefore US$17.70, and the cost for the semester of the domain name is US$5.24.
- While the project still has a bus factor of 1, my personal stability is critical for the project. Barring exceptional circumstances, I should be able to continue working on it through graduation thanks to the university and government's student financial aid, and my family's financial support.
- Significant volunteer involvement and/or external investment will be necessary for a full implementation of this project.

## Steps dependent on interpersonal connections
- Establish the physical community. This will require initial capital of *at least* tens of thousands of US dollars, as well as support for ongoing expenses.
- Create a non-profit organization to manage and be responsible for the project
- Ensure that organization's financial stability (through sources such as an endowment and grants)
- Transfer control of the project's assets (Web presence, etc.) to that organization 

## Development

These tasks are much less important than the above, but are much easier and comprehensible for me. Consequently, this is where most of my work so far has been.

- Develop, write, test, and document specifications
  - Community governance specifications
  - Technology information and specifications (engineering, construction, information technology, etc.), without dependencies (enough information should be included to enable full construction of all technologies starting from nature, without any existing knowledge or technology/machinery; this should be _tested_)
- Continue development of support software
- Develop software for information technology environment (EITE)
  - Finish specifying and build JavaScript implementation of portable, trivial staging language (StageL)
  - Port existing EITE implementation to StageL
  - Provide and implement StageL inside EITE
  - Get text rendering implemented in EITE
  - UI widgets
  - Implement simple document editor in EITE
  - Complex text rendering support
  - Other EITE development tasks: networking, data storage and distribution, etc.
  - Write C implementation of StageL
  - Benchmark JavaScript implementation versus C→WebAssembly, out of curiosity. WASM would require clang in the toolchain, which wouldn't be ideal until clang can be run on non-WASM EITE, but anyway...
  - An alternative strategy could omit implementing the technology, and only focusing on developing the specification, although that strategy would risk increasing the problems the project is intended to fix (by providing existing IT companies with the project’s technological innovations, but not having a free/libre implementation of them to prevent existing companies using distorted clones of the idea to further their proprietary goals and vendor lock-in).
- Write/compile the library
  - Write, compile, and organize content for part 1 of the library
    - Specifications (from above)
    - Subject area information (history, mathematics, linguistics, engineering, etc.)
  - Continue compiling part 2 of the library
- (Dependent on additional finances, land, and people) Provide physical cloud computing infrastructure
- Figure out how to connect the community's network to the Internet, somehow (its connection shouldn't be dependent on external parties: it should follow the Internet Archive's model of being an AS with peering agreements) to allow accessing and preserving the knowledge there. In accordance with avoiding dependencies on external resources, the Internet should likely not be relied on for providing connectivity, although at least in the beginning it is useful for communication to facilitate the project, and perhaps the benefits of providing Internet-based remote login to the information technology environment would outweigh the risks.

# Features of the proposed solution, in detail

## Design principles

These design goals are present to attempt to prevent regressions in the availability and utility of the project.

- Buildable: All technologies and materials needed to build, use, and disassemble the design must also meet these design requirements, and must be fully specified in this document, with reference within the design to those other design specifications, so that every design listed here can be built, used, and disassembled without any knowledge outside of this document, beginning with only the materials available naturally.
- Deconstructable: The design should be able to be disassembled and/or reassembled without any damage or loss to the materials used.
- Materials: All materials needed to build and use a design should be:
  - readily available (not rare or geographically restricted)
  - in a form that can be efficiently returned to a natural state if desired at the end of their lifespan (many plastics, for instance, would fail this criterion unless an energy-efficient tool for reversing their creation is available)
  - all technologies needed for their sourcing, processing, and end-of-life processing must meet these requirements
  - in a form that will return to a natural material over time (the goal of this rule is to avoid materials that result in nonbiodegradeable litter like the microparticles that synthetic textiles sometimes produce; it could probably be better expressed)
- Rugged: All item designs should be long-lasting (not disposable, able to function for many years), rugged, and able to function in adverse conditions.
- Safe: All designs should be safe to build, use, disassemble, and biodegrade.
- Reliable: All designs should work predictably and reliably.
- Libre: The designs should follow the principles needed to ensure they are freely usable, drafted here under "Licensing".
  - Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.
- Incremental: This project should be attempted in an incremental, scalable manner, rather than creating a complex system that would need to be implemented all at once to be effective. That way, small improvements can be made without attempting the insurmountable task of improving larger components of society at once. This incremental development would also allow using the strengths of other current and future projects and systems, and collaborating with and complementing them more effectively.

### Licensing

Aside from sections 2 and 3 of the Ember Library, all portions of the Ember project should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements, and all portions of the project original to Ember should be compliant with the Ember Freedom Requirements. (By their nature, sections 2 and 3 of the library cannot practically be fully libre at present; see the "Library" section of the proposal for further information and rationale.) This is likely not yet a legally effective license, due to a lack of available legal expertise to work on it, and consequently, most of the Ember project and its ancillary projects are licensed under the GNU Affero GPL, version 3 (see the licensing information in each individual repository for details). The term "Information", in these requirements, refers to things such as music, software, computer typefaces, visual art, patents and inventions, specifications, schematics for equipment, etc.

#### Rationale

These licensing requirements are present to attempt to prevent regressions in the availability and utility of the Ember project.

#### Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements (EMFR)

For given Information to be compliant with this standard, the following must be true of it:

- Self-contained: All information necessary for the full and complete use of the Information must also be EMFR-compliant.
- Redistributable: The Information must be legally redistributable.
- Source included: The preferred form for editing the Information must be available and EMFR-compliant; when used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, if the Information is in a form that is not the preferred form for editing it, a copy of the Information in the preferred form for editing it must always be included with the other copy.
- Notice of terms: When used by Ember or when presented as EMFR-compliant, documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.
- Irrevocable: The restrictions on the Information that make it EMFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.
- Unencumbered and unencumbering: The Information may not employ any means to prevent or hinder copying or using it freely (e.g. DRM); furthermore, if the Information enables access to information that employs such means, the Information must not be complicit in facilitating those restrictions (for instance, an EMFR-compliant app that allows streaming DRM-protected content to an HDMI content-protection–enabled monitor MUST enable that content to be used freely by the user, and may not simply pass protected content through to the monitor without being able to decrypt it and enable its free use by the user; software like Firefox's content-decryption-module sandbox is thus not EMFR-compliant).

#### Ember Freedom Requirements (EFR)

This is the same as the Ember Minimal Freedom Requirements, with the following additional restrictions:

- Requiring non-misleading attribution: Attribution to the source of the Information must be required; if the Information is a derivative work, it must be made clear that it has been modified from the source information.
- Editable: It must be legal to modify the Information, and to redistribute both modified and/or unmodified copies of the Information.
- Mandatory publication: The Information must be promptly published and made widely available publicly at the cost of distribution or less.
- Copyleft: These requirements must be required to apply to all derivative works of the Information, and must be required to apply to all information packaged with the Information (e.g., non-EFR-compliant firmware may not be provided with an EFR-compliant kernel).
- Inherited: New information created using the Information must be EMFR-compliant.
- Provision as a service: When the Information is provided as a service (as in the case of software being run on a server), the Information must be made readily available to those who access the service, and documentation of these requirements must be provided with the service.
- Notice of terms: Documentation of these requirements must be provided with all copies of the Information.
- Restricted use: The Information may not itself be used as or as part of advertising or propaganda without the agreement of its creator or creators, although it may be used as a tool for the creation of advertising or propaganda.
- Irrevocable: The restrictions on the Information that make it EFR-compliant must be irrevocable, at least until it falls into the public domain by legal necessity.

## Goals

An Ember community should provide useful elements of survival: shelter, nutrition (including food and water), medical care, education, and information. It would do this as its fulfilment of its objective of managing the various needs of a society, by enabling people to be effective participants in that society.

One role of Ember would be to provide goods. For this, it would be ideal for Ember to control as much of the supply chain as possible. That would allow efficient provision of the goods such as to reduce cost and ensure quality. That control of the supply chain would, in an ideal scenario, extend to all stages of the process, from production of the raw materials to component production to assembly to distribution, as well as shipping at all stages of the process. If Ember both controlled production of raw materials in a region and was the dominant institution working to ensure that those resources are used responsibly, it would of course be important to take the interest Ember has in using the resources sustainably into consideration.

There should be a universally and easily accessible facility to allow the community to vote easily, with systems in place to prevent voter suppression or intimidation.

## Rationale

Human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, a unified institution with the aim of remedying these issues should be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures. Participation in Ember communities shall be dependent on agreement to specified terms, to best protect the rights of the individuals making up the community.

## Specification document

The most significant knowledge assets of the project should comprise a book, which is equivalent to part 1 of the library, with the information technology environment implementation and part 2 of the library provided with it. That could take the form of an ebook, a physical printed book, or other innovative document formats. It should include specifications of the project philosophy and rationale, community, technology and engineering, and goods and services, as well as a carefully prepared compilation of other important knowledge.

## Designs

The Ember project should develop designs for things such as clothing, tools, and housing. Any finished design provided by the project should conform to some specific traits.

## Community

An Ember community is a group of individuals who have chosen to create an Ember community, and to live in accordance with shared principles so as to best protect individuals' rights.

This organization should not impose restrictions on those who chose to become its members apart from those necessary for the protection of their rights, and anyone should be able to choose to become a part of it or to leave it at any time. Joining the organization would involve being listed in the central Ember computing environment database, presumably with sufficient biometric data to prevent identity theft or other fraudulent activity. Names, addresses, or other such personal information, beyond the biometric data previously mentioned, would not be required for the process of becoming a member. Members are not obligated to use any of the services provided by Ember, and could request at any time the termination of any services presently provided to them. In consideration of the "right to die" debate, perhaps people should be able to (revocably, of course, and only if they can give meaningful consent) even request termination of the basic protection of their human rights such as emergency medical care that any community should by default provide as best as possible to anyone regardless of affiliation.

There are many other concerns relevant to the management of a community, as well; a thorough assessment and consideration of management and governance principles and relevant historical experience would be a prerequisite for the development of the community proposed here.

## Services collective

This proposal advocates the creation of a project to develop an adequate infrastructure for managing and providing for the basic needs of society. This organization could exist alongside governments and other social structures, as well as potentially taking their place in the event that they collapse or fail to perform as expected.

Humans have come to expect and rely upon social constructs for their safety and mutual benefit, but human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords. Consequently, there is a need for a unified institution to be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures to provide some semblance of a filling of this void. The general rules of this organization should be established on the basis of rights: rather than making a rule that, for example, prohibits murder, instead a rule should be established that protects individuals’ right to life. In such a way, rules would not be created that infringe freedom more than that which is necessary to retain order in society.

This project would, in its complete form, provide useful elements of survival: shelter, nutrition (including food and water), medical care, education, and information. It would do this as its fulfilment of its objective of managing the various needs of a society, by enabling people to be effective participants in that society.

An Ember community's services collective is a not-for-profit that organizes the procurement and distribution of goods and services for its members, and perhaps others as well. The goal of this organization would be to provide any needful things desired by its members for their lives. For instance, if a person chose to receive food through Ember, they could request that it be provided in exchange for labor. Their labor would help contribute to services requested in the future by them or other Ember members. The organization should have 24/7 available buildings staffed by Ember members from whom aid could be sought, such as the furnishing of meals, shelter, clothing, access to information, or other services, in exchange for labor. That way, if an Ember member is in trouble in an unfamiliar town, for instance, with no money, identification (beyond their own body), or other resources, they could go to the local Ember building to receive any services they desire; they could even build up credit in preparation for such an incident by working for the Ember collective prior to taking a trip, for instance, so they would have already earned any services they might want (thus acting as travel insurance, in a sense).

A self-contained automated crop growing system could be constructed that would accept a seed as input and produce crops and more seed as output. This could be used for easily growing many types of plant, by providing different growing instructions and seeds as needed. It could also be built in a way that tries to use energy from the environment efficiently, and avoid excessive use of mains power. This would be helpful in simplifying access to plant products, even plants that are not commonly available easily. This principle could be applied to goods in general, using production on demand to reduce waste and transportation and storage costs. Such a system would require a level of technology that will likely take a while to develop without proprietary dependencies.

## Library

The library is divided into three sections, each increasingly broad in scope. Sections 2 and 3 are the only parts of the project that are not fully libre-licensed, due to the inclusion of non-libre-licensed third-party-owned contents in the libraries. The inclusion of some non-libre contents is justified in these cases because of their cultural and historic importance, because they are not dependencies of any other parts of the project, and in the general interest of preserving knowledge. The non-libre contents should of course not be relied upon outside of their role as cultural knowledge artifacts.

## Library Section 1: Basic knowledge, to be included in the text of the project specification

This section of the library will require research and writing. It should consist of many short sections, each covering a topic. Each of these sections should list all other sections that must be understood as prerequisites for understanding it. Ideally, the dependency tree of every section should culminate in a single section that gives a basic understanding of the dominant language of the reference (probably English, for the forseeable future), so that by translating that one section into another language, every other concept in the reference can be understood by reading its section and its section's prerequisites.

It should include specifications of the project philosophy and rationale, community, technology and engineering, and goods and services.

## Library Section 2: Great cultural works, to be included as digital data with the project specification

Work has begun on compiling this section of the library, but its utility is restricted by many relevant assets being under copyright but not libre-licensed.

## Library Section 3: The data held by the EITE cloud infrastructure

This section of the library will presumably be too much information to be included in the project specification, although future information storage technology advances may render that less of an issue.

## Information technology environment

### Introduction

This section proposes developing an information technology system that allows various types of data to be given a first-class role. The proposed system is a centralized but non-centralization-dependent append-only information store, a computer operating system integrated with that information store, and related specifications.

Web-based information technology companies such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook have a disproportionately large amount of power, have a disproportionately large role in how individuals are able to conduct their daily lives, and are single points of failure for a large portion of the modern lifestyle. These corporations are private institutions with little to no public oversight and control, despite having a large and visible role (perhaps even larger than any one government) in individuals’ lives. To begin to challenge that power structure, this semi-decentralized document-oriented computing platform should be developed that can integrate the abilities of traditional information technology systems into a single, cohesive system. Such a system should be free/libre software, and should be designed in such a way that it can adapt when needed to functioning as a fully decentralized, serverless system, transparently adjusting to the networking capabilities or lack thereof available to it on an ad-hoc basis. The existence of this project as a replacement would prevent single IT companies’ systems being single points of failure, and its distributed model would prevent it itself from being a single point of failure. Additionally, by being fully free/libre software, and by using a single system and data format for the full range of services, this proposal would reduce the dangers created by vendor lock-in, proprietary products, and incompatible IT systems.

People that would be especially benefited by the full form of this project include individuals from marginalized groups, especially those with disabilities, mental illnesses, and the homeless, by enabling them to support themselves through a community and reducing barriers presented to them by discrimination, and by reducing the need for individuals’ dependence on the traditional monetary economy.

An important basic principle of EITE is flexibility. It should allow the user do what they want in an elegant manner, without undue shenanigans, difficult workarounds, or unwanted assistance. It should accommodate various workflows, and be thoroughly customizable. Its default configuration should be simple and easy to use. User interfaces should abstract away technical complexities by default while remaining fully usable, while allowing access to those complexities if desired.

The system should use a single, libre, fully specified data format to store all types of information it processes, and development of the system should strive to ensure that a thorough selection of capabilities are provided out of the box using a consistent and customizable user interface, obviating the need for external apps (which often tend to be inconsistent in things such as internationalization and accessibility). The use of a single data format would allow, for instance, text, structured data, sound, and interactive media such as computer games to all be practically equivalent to each other, such that wherever one could be used, another could be used instead, ensuring thorough flexibility. (External apps should be possible to use, for instance as references to facilitate developing libre alternatives, as well as to provide historical access and allow verifying that libre alternatives are actually equivalent, but while they should be possible to use, they should not be _necessary_ to use.)

### Overview

The computing environment will consist of the following components (subject to change):

- Development principles, describing the process to use for creating the computing environment
- Data formats
  - Specifications
  - Reference implementations
- Data storage: append-only set of records, each comprising a unique ID paired with a node document
- Client app
- Server apps:
  - Public-facing API
  - Search engine
  - Storage backend
    
### Development principles

- Never remove a feature, capability, or option. If the development of an improved architecture or addition of new features involves scrapping existing code, reintroduce all previously existing capabilities before releasing the changes to the software.
- Make sure that all tests pass when releasing changes to the software.
- Thorough automated unit tests should be provided and kept passing.

#### Prerequisites for code to be added to the repository

- Code must be readable and documented.
- Code must not cause or have failing tests.
- Code should include thorough automatic test coverage.
- Code must address a deviation from the current specification (bug, missing feature, etc.), and may not contain code unrelated to that.

#### How issues should be prioritised

Ordered from highest priority to lowest priority

- Security vulnerabilities
- Functional regressions
- Incorrect results
- Crashes and similar critical usability issues
- Slow code with a significant impact on usability
- Aesthetic regressions
- Minor usability issues
- Slow code with a moderate impact on usability
- Missing features

### Further principles

One of its fundamental elements would be the creation of a cloud-based information technology system, intended to provide effective and efficient information storage and retrieval (ISR). This would likely use an append-only NoSQL database to store a softly directed concept graph. Most or all knowledge can be effectively represented using two basic structures: nodes and relationships. Relationships would be specific types of nodes. Each node would correspond to a document stored as a sequence of character-like digital identifiers ("Dcs") analogous to both characters in a computer character encoding and to assembly language opcodes, allowing all types of electronic data to be stored as strings. These strings would be able to hold any structured data through the use of specific Dcs, such that when a document was added to the ISR system, it could be indexed deterministically into a separate database which would cache the structured information extracted from that document.

The nodes of a graph are the individual records that it stores. Relationships between those nodes are the edges of the graph, although it is possible that the system I am developing will provide for more complex relationships, for example by allowing relationships to connect several nodes to each other in a variety of ways, although whether that proves necessary or useful remains to be seen. Metadata are an item’s traits: information such as the title of a node, or a description of it. The way I have designed this system, placing all three of these types of entity into one table, allows relationships and metadata to have the attributes of nodes: for example, metadata could be attached to a relationship or another metadatum, or relationships could be specified that connect any combination of the three. There are many existing ISR systems, such as flat files and flat searching, flat-search filterable record sets, sorted records, a variety of tree and tree-like structures, tagged or labeled records, traditional tabular databases, relational databases, sparse tables, sparse matrices and entity-attribute-value models, graphs and digraphs, Boolean-queriable datasets, hierarchies, automated natural-language document acquisition and indexing, metadata-enriched natural-language document acquisition and indexing, and selective-display intelligent query results. The system I am proposing would primarily leverage a graph structure augmented through the use of richly labeled nodes, providing great flexibility in the structures it can manage; in addition, the above structures could be emulated within a graph-driven environment for when they are preferred.

This will also provide effective options for implementing the wide variety of existing ISR systems outlined above as both self-hosted applications executed both in the cloud and in userspace.

There are a variety of content sources that would populate this ISR system: publicly available datasets, creative works, and other resources; resources added and/or created by individuals using the system; “dark” content such as is currently held by social networks, governments, and other organizations that do not publicly release their records; moderated content that has been reviewed and fact-checked and annotated as such by the NGO; dynamically generated content; and computed content, for example, the results from a mathematical calculation or an operation on a dataset.

This ISR system should be leveraged by the NGO for several purposes. First, it can be used to record the individuals who are participants in the NGO. Through the development and application of a biometrics system, perhaps similar to that of India’s Aadhaar program, the use of names could be easily foregone, allowing for people who are mononymous, change their name frequently, have unconventional names, have no name, and so on and so forth to easily use the system, without being subjected to the usual tribulations that accompany any of the above in many modern governments. (It would also eliminate similar gender identity and other issues in receiving government services.) While instability of identification traits in individuals, either through subversion of the system or through chance, is indeed a concern, both for positive and negative identification (Sahoo, Choubisa, and Prasanna: “Multimodal Biometric Person Authentication: A Review”. 2012. In _IETE Technical Review_, vol. 29 issue 1, January–February 2012), hopefully a sufficiently deep set of metrics could be established to prevent this from being an issue. When an individual becomes part of the NGO, they would be enrolled in the biometric identification system, and provided a system for communication and tracking of some type. This could take several forms: the most practical and useful, probably, would be a wristwatch-like interface to cloud computing systems that would contain a GPS system and other useful electronics. The purpose of this would be the providing of emergency services: in the event of an emergency, the wearer could interact in it in a way to convey the existence and, if possible, the nature and situation of an emergency. This information would be entered automatically into the ISR system, which would provide a report of the emergency, including the person’s location, their direction and speed of travel, any known health conditions, their current health state (heart rate, blood pressure, and such). The system could automatically delegate the emergency to a nearby station of the NGO, which would act (presumably with the assistance of emergency response services) to resolve the situation.

Education and qualifications could be tracked through this system, as could taxes. For example, when a person completed testing by the organisation in a given subject, that score could be recorded in their profile in such a way that it could be used to determine what jobs they are allowed to work at. Taxation should be managed through time, so that a person would put in a certain number of hours of work selected from the jobs that need doing according to the ISR’s task record tracking system (possibly the number of hours necessary for a given amount of the organization’s services provided would be related to the level of qualification necessary for the work in question) to receive the organisation’s services in exchange. The person could choose which services to allocate their time credits to — for example, requesting food credits, requesting tickets to operas, or donating them to charity. In such a way, the taxes levied would hopefully never have to be put to a use the individual considered unethical. Inter-personal trading could also be facilitated through the ISR system. Such an information technology system to manage and facilitate work by individuals, tracking what needs to be done and what skills people have, and offering jobs to people with the relevant skills, would allow the individuals to bypass the difficult job search and application process, which uses a lot of individuals’ time and energy without producing any real value from that expenditure. Then, when a job is completed, the person who did the work would be granted credits corresponding to the work they did, which could then be exchanged for goods or services. This type of system could be implemented as a single, centralized system. However, it could also be implemented as a decentralized system.

To decentralize such a system, individual computers that make up the information technology system would have to be able to negotiate information sharing between other computers that are accessible via network. If each individual computer has the entire capability to maintain the system, then the network would be able to split and recombine as needed depending on situation.

For instance, two geographically remote implementations of this system would be able to be connected when a network connection between them was available, being able to share work assignments remotely, but if a storm or other situation disrupted the network connection, the two communities’ economies would split into separate economies and continue working independently seamlessly, and then recombine when the network connection returned. In such a system, each individual who has a computer thus has access to and control over that part of the economy. This still leaves one centralized aspect, though, which is the software controlling the economies. If it is community-maintained libre software, that problem is largely eliminated, aside from the usual problems of project governance. If it is preferred, the software could also have facilities for creating ad-hoc centralization, where one instance of the software within each group of instances accessible within a given network would adopt the role of leader. This could be decided automatically, and made fully invisible to users of the system, or through community selection with automatic selection as a fallback, which would probably be preferable so as to ensure that systems with good connectivity and uptime (such as servers in datacenters) were selected as leaders, avoiding unnecessary inefficiency and maximizing reliability.

Thorough user group and subgroup support should be provided. This would be especially useful for facilitating collaboration between individuals, such as in business use of the software.

### Semantic representation

There are two principle structural levels for which elements need to be described: documents and texts. A document is a complete unit such as a book or journal article, which would comprise various textual regions (note that in typesetting some items, such as database records of titles or filenames, only one textual region would be used; in the first, either a "Document Title" or a "Standard" region type would be used, depending on how the database was being queried, that is, the presentation style of the information as a title or as standard text (such as if it were being displayed in a page that contained a list of database fields), and in the second, a "Standard" region type would be used for interface display in lists (other region types might be used at other times) (note that in any use cases when it is in a "Standard" textual region, it would still have the text type Title)). A textual region is a section of content that has one semantic componency, e. g. the body of a document or the title; a document is therefore comprised of texts.

- Liberal relationship formation and node typing: A node can be assigned any other node as its type; a relationship can be from any type of node to any other type of node even if that is not how the relationship is defined (this situation could display a warning, for example).
- Authority contexts: Information should be able to be tagged with information on its authority. When used at the node level, as opposed to within document content, authority context information should be validated to ensure the utility of the available nodes (so that the authority context tagging can be used to evaluate the reliability of a given document). For instance, objective consensus, reflecting a neutral point of view, not necessarily trying to represent all points of view equally because of lack of consensus about them, versus subjective individual/organization source, representing an individual or organization's opinion, without necessarily any regard for a neutral point of view, such as in opinion writing or advertising.

A node is a document, represented as a sequence of Dcs, stored in the EITE system. A document created by an individual would presumably, when stored as a node, have additional information not managed by the individual, such as who has the right to read and edit it. Thus, the document an individual would work with would be stored as a portion of a larger document representing its corresponding node. Because the system is append-only, nodes would have revisions, representing each time it was changed. For letter-by-letter changes, produced while typing without saving, instead of saving a new revision, letter-by-letter change tracking and storage could be used, such as is used by Etherpad.

Various fully featured ways to interact with the system should be provided. For instance, a graphical interface, a command-line interface, and a UNIX-style "everything is a file" interface. (Filesystems, especially APIs exposed as filesystem entities have their own challenges and risks, such as confusing scripts that aren't designed to work with anything except plain old files, having unusual structures such as files not present in any directory, infinite directory trees resulting from hardlinks to directories, files with multiple forks, or named pipes, and if providing nodes by filename, having files and directories with the same names or directories with a data fork; these issues will need work and research to resolve well and provide good user experiences.)

#### Complex Dc sequences, Sequence Builders, and Dynamic Sets

A complex sequence of Dcs could be built using special-purpose input tools for constructing them. For instance, purpose-built tools could be provided for constructing a sequence of Dcs representing a mathematical equation, or a sequence of Dcs representing a given time or color.

Similarly, a special type of sequence builder could be used to build sets of values. For instance, for selecting a document to send to someone, a document set builder dialog could be provided. It would allow selecting one or more documents to send manually, or selecting one or more documents by specifying rules for their selection. Then, the set containing the chosen node or nodes (optionally, at their present revision) is saved as a node; that set node is then provided to the person one is communicating to; the same interface could be used for selecting files for working with in an app. Sets could have restrictions, such as regarding how many documents they could contain, whether they could contain complex structures (such as a directory tree), whether one document could be swapped out with another or not, or whether the set should automatically gather new nodes matching the specified rules. Sets could also be driven by search criteria (e.g. the most relevant 10 nodes for a given keyword or given Boolean search conditions, or all four nodes with type Musician and a "is member of" relationship to "The Beatles", or the rapidly changing set of nodes with type Musician and a current or past "is member of" relationship to "Yes"), or built programmatically from new or existing nodes. Sets could also hold non-node strings. (Node IDs, as with everything else, can be considered as special cases of strings.) This would allow file uploads, searches, etc. to all be driven using the same basic user interface module, which would essentially be an extension of traditional file pickers. The set node would have a Dc sequence representation, as do all nodes, so this is really a Dc sequence builder. Like anything else in EITE, by virtue of being an append-only system, a set could "time travel": a set could display its contents as they would be at any past time. Another application of the set builder could be creating a document that displayed the current top 10 tracks on the Billboard Hot 100 — a set could be created representing the top 10, and a rule could be created if desired to deal with the condition if the Hot 100 was discontinued: the set could be configured to return nothing, to return a fixed list, to return the top 10 from the final edition of the charts, _et cetera_. A set builder could also be used to select dynamic and non-finite groups of things, such as the set of all integers, or all strings matching a given language syntax; this ability would be similar to the lazy evaluation used frequently in functional programming.

### Implementation challenges and strategy

An implementation of a simple state-machine–driven interpreter of the token-based document format specification for the information technology environment aspect of the project is under way. There have been several previous attempts at developing this, but they have not worked out for various reasons. The first implementation was in PHP, and had poor architecture and rather unmaintainable code. A second attempt in Java was excessively ambitious in attempting to parse a programming-language-style document format interactively, without any specification and only minimal planning or architecture, as well as being highly overengineered. An attempt in PHP and JQuery to build a user interface toolkit based on these principles crashed and burned due to poor code architecture and attempting to “put the cart before the horse” in developing a UI toolkit without any specification for it, and without consideration of the existing (specified) aspects of the format. A fresh attempt in PHP stalled due to also being rather unmaintainable and awkwardly written, specifically in its use of dynamically written JavaScript, and trouble storing arbitrary binary content, independent of character encoding, in HTML text boxes (which are really the wrong tool for the job). An implementation in Bash was considered and a command-line interface designed for it, but probably this will simply become a wrapper around the JavaScript implementation. The JavaScript implementation here will attempt to avoid these issues by only implementing what has already been specified, not attempting to handle the programming-language-style format yet, using extensive unit tests (which was very helpful in the Java implementation), and using modularized code (which has been helpful in successful projects undertaken in the interim), and by planning the architecture of the code (shown in the diagram below) before implementing it. A staging language will be implemented in JavaScript to allow the code written for the project to be trivially portable to other platforms and languages.

What I am able to develop, practically speaking, is simply a technology demo and beginning of an implementation of a tool with larger scope. Consequently, it will presumably be rather limited in its practical utility, making it not suitable for a general audience, and mainly useful as a tool for demonstrating some of the principles used in this project, and as a core starting-point for the implementation of a more substantial and practically useful set of capabilities.

### StageL

#### Overview

A simple programming language should be provided for easily writing portable algorithms to be transpiled to and used by programs in other languages. The name "StageL" comes from calling it a "staging language" (which refers to its being a tool for developing the main EITE software, which should provide a more complete language). This project was inspired by the ugly code that resulted when I tried to write using these principles directly in JavaScript, needing a lot of easy-to-mess-up boilerplate code and awkward notation (largely because it is not strongly typed).

#### Design goals

- Imperative language. Trivial to implement, learn, and read; extremely portable.
- Provide function calls, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and operators for these types with strict typing. Objects and first-class functions are out of scope for this language.
- Commonly used more complex constructs, such as arbitrary-precision numbers and associative arrays, should be offered as abstractions implemented within StageL as part of a common library of reference code.
- Implemented as a transpiler that accepts a file as input and produces a file in the target language as output.
- Have an implementation of itself using itself, to provide testing and portability of the language.
- Have an implementation in Bash.
- Should probably transpile to (at least) JavaScript, C, Java, Bash, PHP, WebAssembly, Microsoft CIL, Lisp, x86 assembly, and Python, in roughly that order of priority. (JavaScript is desired as soon as possible for work on the main EITE software; C and Java should follow soon thereafter for their portability; the other languages are nice to have to cover a diverse range of development environments, and additionally, in the case of CIL/x86 assembly/Lisp, of providing interesting challenges in ensuring that the language really is easily portable due to their difference from the others.)
- Focus on simplicity and portability: it should purely be an algorithm representation format, without input/output capabilities. StageL is for implementing the algorithms of a program once, and having it be available in various languages. Things such as input/output and native calls should be provided as an API specification for the StageL source file: at the top of the file, it should declare all the implementation-dependent functions that it requires; these would then be provided separately by the programmer and/or by a set of functions provided with StageL for each target language.
- All input/output to/from/within the language takes the form of functions. All code must be in a function, with declared parameters, parameter types, variables needed, and return type. (The expense of the simple type system is that changing return values would break functions' API, since "out" parameters and/or pointers would not be available, but this should allow the code to be simple and readable, which is a priority for this language.)
- Output files should retain the structure and comments of the input files, thereby retaining readability as far as the target language permits.
- All behavior should be specified. Ambiguous programs should be impossible to write knowing the specification, and (as far as possible) the meaning of a program should be obvious and unambiguous _without_ the language specification. Programs that do not match the specification exactly should be entirely rejected, rather than produce warnings or have a best guess of its meaning made.

### EITE document formats

There are two conceptually significant document formats for storing EITE data. Both formats consist of a sequence of Dcs. The simpler format would be a simple list of Dcs, similar to a character-based text encoding. The more complex format (the "EITE Language") would be a traditional programming language. The two formats should share a one-to-one equivalency for a given document, and merely be different ways of representing that document.

### EITE Language

Note that the syntax specifications are not included here, as they are lengthy, incomplete, and likely to be changed in the course of further development.

#### Objective

Develop a machine-readable language that can be implemented using StageL, and transpiled into StageL if desired. It should be practically useable as a shell as well as for running stored programs.

#### Language profiles

EITE Language programs may optionally declare a non-default language profile to use: Core, Basic, and Dangerous (the default is "Standard"). Core and Basic both restrict the program to a subset of the language. The Basic language interpreter is written using the Core subset of the language, and provides useful shortcuts to use in the development of the interpreter for the Standard profile. The Default language interpreter is written using the Basic subset of the language. The Dangerous profile allows using language features which are probably a bad idea to use, but may be needed in some cases.

#### Dcs

The core unit of the EITE Language is the Dc (Document Component). The defined Dcs are listed in DcData.csv. An EITE Language document is a list of Dcs, and a file is considered _structurally valid_ if it can be interpreted as such. A Dc can have a syntactical pattern that it can require if it is to be meaningful. For example, a marker to _begin_ a section of a document might be required to have a matching _end_ marker. A document is only _syntactically valid_ if the usage of each Dc contained within it conforms to the Dc's defined syntax, even if the document is otherwise structurally valid.

#### Structures in the EITE Language

The EITE Language uses the following main types of entity to represent information.

##### Type

Types are templates describing the structure of objects. They are known as prototypes or classes in most programming languages, depending on whether objects described by them inherit changes to the types made after the object was created. (Objects can be used as types by casting.) Type names begin with a capital letter when in source form.

##### Object

An object is an entity that conforms to a given type (an _instance_ of that type). The most general type is _object_, and there is no need for an object to conform to any other type.

##### Block

A block is a group of statements.

##### Project

A project is a single document, and if relevant, any other documents maintained as part of that document.

##### Module

A module is one or more Library-mode documents that have a package name for addressing the things they provide.

##### List

A list is an ordered list of objects.

##### String

A string is a list of Dcs. Because all Dcs can be used in strings, any data type can be cast to a string, and all data types internally _are_ strings of Dcs.

##### Routine

A routine is a set of instructions for a computer to follow as part of the process of interpreting a document. Similar concepts are known as functions or subroutines in most programming languages, or as methods when used within objects. Routines have an associated structure that indicates what parameters may be passed to it.

##### Operator

An operator is a short notation or syntax pattern for some common routines (e.g., `Number a + Number b` in place of `add(Number a, Number b)`.

##### Identifier

An identifier is a name for an object.

##### Structure

A structure is the definition of what the structure is that an entity can have, similar to type definitions or type signatures in some programming languages. A type can contain named Structures without any values for defining an interface.

##### Statement

A statement is a logical line of a document. It can be an invocation of a routine, or a declaration of an entity's structure or value.

# Alignment of the project approach to the traits of the currently emerging new media

Henry Jenkins's article "Eight Traits of the New Media Landscape" (http://nmdprojects.net/teaching_resources/jenkins_eight_traits_of_new_media.pdf) provides eight traits that its author observes in the prominent currently emerging new media. This section of the proposal evaluates this project's expression of this set of traits.

The first of these traits is _innovation_. As a communication medium, the information technology environment aspect of this project proposal is arguably merely an extension and refinement of existing communication media, and so may not be considered true innovation, depending on perspective. Even in that case, however, because those existing media are themselves innovative, this project remains a work within new media, even if it is not itself a new medium.

The second trait is _convergence_. This proposal is highly convergent, being a broadly scoped project to innovate across a wide range of aspects of society, industry, and technology. Even regarding only the information technology environment, it is intended to inherit the capabilities of existing computers, which are used for text, sound, image, video, and interactive media, among others.

The third defining trait is _everyday_ presence. As a project to develop a unified system providing all the knowledge resources needed for running a society, if it is successfully completed and used to its envisioned potential, it would serve as the framework for people's everyday lives. When only available in partial form, those portions of it can be used in everyday settings as well (e.g. large chunks of my classwork and other data I rely on and use on an everyday basis (personal projects, music library, email, etc.) are stored and managed using software developed in the course of developing this project).

The fourth trait is _appropriation_. This proposed project ideally will be highly appropriative, because so much work has already been done. It would in all probability be hugely wasteful and impractical to attempt to build everything from scratch, rather than to leverage existing systems (even if only practical through inspiration!) and merely work to fill gaps and integrate the various existing technologies well. That said, reliance on proprietary or externally managed technologies should be eliminated as soon as practical, with all elements of the project and its dependencies being fully libre, because proprietary, non-maintainable, and trade-dependent systems are brittle and are a huge threat to the ability of human society to maintain its standards of living over time. Any external dependencies of the project should be libre, so they can be forked and maintained if necessary.

The fifth trait is _networkedness_. As a design goal for this project, networking should be provided when available, but never mandatory. Systems that depend entirely on networking are, echoing the discussion of the fourth point, brittle. A cloud computing–backed virtual digital assistant, for instance, is thoroughly useless in the event of networking being unavailable. Once constructed, the best tools would be fully usable in a vacuum.

The sixth trait is being _global_. The proposed project is intended to be able to be geographically dispersed, although individual communities would only be able to collaborate on physical projects by being physically colocated, for obvious reasons.

The seventh trait is _generational_. Whether an age gap will affect this project is hard to predict. If it does, it should only be by the choice of individuals, rather than by inaccessibility or prejudice: if people who are a different age than the majority involved in the project, those people should be provided any necessary accommodations to the fullest extent possible (medical care for the elderly, education for the young, and so on). This project should not engage in discrimination based on age, although it could only serve adults until a sufficient child protection framework is in place (e.g. I think Google doesn't allow kids to use it, so this presumably shouldn't either).

The eighth trait is _inequality_. Unfortunately, this likely may affect the project initially, because a community would presumably be unable to sufficiently support individuals with some disabilities to modern standards until it was somewhat technologically sophisticated, meaning that people involved in the project would need to be able to provide for themselves and (for the physical community or communities) provide transportation for access, restricting practical use of the project to those who are wealthy or otherwise supported. Working to reduce undesired inequality as much as possible should be a design goal of the project, while promoting diversity and freedom.

### App Store reviews: ________________

I have recieved no comments on the app, although it does not do anything yet from a user perspective (other than use several hundred lines of code to print "Hello, World!", and run very slowly).

### Face-to-face community: ________________

I would like to use the advantages provided by the University environment during this last year of my attendence to connect with people interested in this project. I am currently the only person working on the project, although I have talked about it briefly in the context of class presentations, and have discussed it a bit with a few professors.

### Influencers: ________________

I hope to connect with people who have skill communicating and connecting with other people who would be interested in the project. I am currently the only person working on the project.

### YouTube subscribers: ________________

I have two subscribers on my personal YouTube account, and none on my official account.

## Manual Vector

How will you inject your meme?

### Submitting an app

An app can be distributed as a Web page, as a stand-alone downloadable app (as a file, through operating system package managers), and as a boot-to-app OS. All of these are reasonable distribution platforms for EITE, although likely only native apps would be able to run the server part of the app. (Different platforms have different limitations on what apps are able to accomplish, as a result of environment (hardware, software, network, etc.) limitations.)

### Clothing

This would be possible, pretty much being a walking poster. It probably would cost a large amount of money to get a professional looking customized shirt, though, and a hand-made one would not necessarily be very convincing.

### Flashmob

There would need to be more people. A single-person flashmob wouldn't be particularly visible.

### Launch event

I don't know how to do this, or what it would involve. It sounds expensive, complicated, and liable to have no one show up....

### Postcards

These could possibly be useful as a way to communicate with people working on the project if they are far away. Until there are distant people, though, they wouldn't be worth the cost (it's expensive to print and mail, and each postcard presumably only would reach a few people, unlike a poster).

### Posters

I have designed a poster to help promote this project.

### Stickers

If people with vehicles want them, they could be funded and made. Since I do not have a vehicle, this is a low priority for me.

### Embedding (YouTube)

This is no longer necessary with the availabilty of HTML5 video.

### Linking in comments (YouTube)

This is quite useful, although YouTube actually calls it the "Description" (it's separate from the comments). Providing information and links related to the video allows people who were interested in the video to pursue the project.

## Automatic Vector

How will computers spread your meme?

### IFTTT

This is a tool for constructing simple tasks using Web services' APIs. It does not seem relevant to this project.

## Payload

What's the smallest unit of meaning you hope to circulate?

### App-payload: ________________

The EITE client and server apps are proposed above.

### URL-blog: ________________

This proposal could be polished and published as a Web page. Alternatively or in addition, it should be used to fill out the content in the project's Web site.

### Video: ________________

A video introduction to the project can be created to serve as an aid to recruit other people to work on this.

## Recognition

How will you measure success?

There are two primary success metrics for this semester. One is the progress I make on a prototype and strategy development; another is how many other people I can convince to work on the project with me.

### App downloads/sales

This can be estimated by how it corresponds roughly to the number of people who work on the project with me, which is presumably an upper bound on the number. Some people who want to use the app easily but not worry about developing it (e.g. people who find it useful but are working on non-EITE aspects of the project) would use this method of engagement.

### Web site hits

The Web host I am currently using tracks this automatically, but it is of dubious reliability (doesn't indicate how many people are actually interested in working on the project). The number of people who contact and talk to me about it would be a more reliable metric.

### Google Analytics

I don't use this. It's proprietary, it contributes unnecessarily to page CPU and network load, it invades the privacy of people who have used it, and it doesn't measure people with any familiarity with computers, since they would use uBlock Origin or similar software to prevent it loading.

### Google Pagerank

Google Pagerank was discontinued in 2016.

### Money

People with money may become interested in investing it in this project. If so, any contributions and expenditures should be tracked carefully, with the information publicly available to ensure that contributions are used efficiently. Only my personal funds are used at present.

### Credibility (Diggs/Karma)

As an undergraduate student with good grades, I have a moderate but fairly low amount of credibility. My lack of work experience in related fields may affect that as well. (My résumé and the software I have developed are available online, which can help people evaluate my experience, giving me more credibility.)

### Reader comments

People communicating with me to join forces on working on this project is the primary quantifiable metric of success for this semester, I think.

### YouTube views

These are available via YouTube video page. People who contact me are more helpful than people who watch a video but are not interested enough to proceed.

## Evidence of the problem
- _Digital Amnesia_ (2014 film) (https://archive.org/download/DigitalAmnesiaDocumentary/DigitalAmnesiaDocumentary.HD.mp4) is an informative and accessible introduction to a few of the immense modern losses of and threats to historical knowledge.
- Madge, Robert. "GDPR: data portability is a false promise" (https://medium.com/mydata/gdpr-data-portability-is-a-false-promise-af460d35a629). 2017 July 4, in _MyData_.: This article discusses how corporations, when charged with preserving individuals' electronic information, cannot be relied upon to make it easy to transfer to other information technology environments; even if the data can be exported, which is rarely available as a lossless option, it cannot necessarily be transferred to other services due to the lack of standardization. At a minimum, lossless information exporting should be available, with documentation of the format in which it is exported. Google Drive, for instance, does not provide any lossless, documented, supported export format. They offer some supported and documented formats, but they are not lossless (particularly significant is the absence of export of document revision history, despite that history being stored and exposed via the user interface). Some success has been reported with retrieving their native format, but it is not documented, supported, or easily accessible (https://webapps.stackexchange.com/q/45562; http://features.jsomers.net/how-i-reverse-engineered-google-docs/).
- "National Museum of Brazil fire" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Brazil_fire). In _Wikipedia_. This fire exemplifies how organizational apathy to cultural preservation can cause devastating losses.

As corporate-mediated platforms become primary communications media with increasing reliance on them, the effects of using a privately managed platform without the traditional legal protections of press freedom become increasingly pronounced.
- "Deforestation" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation). In _Wikipedia_. Deforestation is one highly visible illustration of the damage done by short-term, profit-driven decisionmaking.

- Bibliotheca Alexandrina (http://bibalex.org/) preserves and provides access to a wide range of knowledge.
- The Long Now Foundation (http://longnow.org/) promotes long-term thinking, which is an important design and ethics principle of this project.
- Free Software Foundation (https://www.fsf.org/) promotes principles of freedom as used in and by this project.
- Bangor Public Library (https://www.bpl.lib.me.us/) provided an environment that stimulated my interest in libraries when I was younger, both in their roles as guardians of knowledge and memory and as social spaces offering resources and a place to go to the public, especially people who are lonely, poor, or otherwise vulnerable. This project incorporates both of those principles.
