The vocal sounds are great.
What is the goal of the non-vocal sounds?
The different sounds didn't seem to be in the same acoustic context/spatiality. I did not really understand this in the context of the recording. Was it intentional? If you want to change this, it could perhaps have reverb applied to the output track instead of just the vocals to blend them together more.
The ending seemed abrupt. Was that intentional?

Response / Critique for Megan Carpenter

The selection of space was interesting, as is the spatiality of the individual sounds within it (there are some near-sounding sounds, and some distant-sounding sounds, and the contrast is effective).
The ending seemed abrupt. Was that intentional?
The recording was quite quiet overall. I think it could use some compression and/or normalization to make it easier to hear.
