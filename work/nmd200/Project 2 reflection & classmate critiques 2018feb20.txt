After you have completed your critique on 2/13, write a 500+ word reflection on Project 2.
Also, give the person who presented before you and the person who presented after you feedback on their final audio recording. Add you feedback on your assigned class mates to the end of your own reflection. Make sure to title each feedback section with the students name that you are giving feedback on (make sure to take note of their names in class!).

• Technical - Do you have any technical advice / resources that might be helpful?
