Reflection on Project 2
====
[target: 655 words]
I thought that this recording was fairly successful. I overshot the one-minute target duration, thinking that it was a minimum rather than a total goal. I have not yet created a shorter edit, although I still intend to. The technical aspects of the recording are somewhat lacking, I think, partly because I am not particularly familiar with Audacity and was to some extent learning "on-the-job", so to speak. (I am much more familiar with the proprietary Logic Pro digital audio workstation from Apple.) I am glad to be getting some experience working with a libre digital audio workstation. I would like to learn Ardour, as well (another libre digital audio workstation), since it seems to be more capable than Audacity. I still feel that it is easier for me to create the sounds I am trying to using Logic than using Audacity, probably due to inherent limitations of it being a primarily sound-file–based application (e.g. applying effects seems to edit the file without a way to automate them over time, or remove them and layer them dynamically). Ardour, I think, provides those abilities. The process of field recording seemed simple enough; the recorder worked well and got a satisfyingly high quality recording, even of the random talking that I wasn't even trying to capture but ended up using in the final recording. Also, while it is not really relevant to the field recording assignment, I do miss Logic's MIDI capabilities when working in Audacity. Ardour has MIDI support, but even it does not support Apple's sample packs and instruments (for the obvious reason of them not being libre-licensed), which I am unfortunately rather fond of. The sound-file–oriented modality of Audacity seems somewhat inefficient when trying to produce anything but the simplest music. The short Project 2 recording, for instance, took at least several hundred megabytes for only a few (maybe eight? ten? tracks), due to each processed version of the sound being a separate copy rather than simply an instruction from the computer to itself to modify the initial sound, which is how most digital audio workstations work. That method of storing the information allows much smaller file sizes, making the creation of music that requires many tracks more practical. Typical pop and electronic dance music production typically uses tens or hundreds of tracks for a three minute or so recording, which would become inordinately large, and therefore rather cumbersome, using Audacity. When I first began work on this recording, the key word for "feeling" that I was trying to pursue was "cozy". While that did not really persist into the finished edited recording that I created, I was nevertheless fairly happy with it, since I feel like the variety of sound objects I discovered within the recording were quite interesting, and I enjoyed exploring them in the course of making this work. As a /musique concrète/ work, I am also fairly pleased with the outcome. Working within the constraints created by the environment I chose (Audacity) helped me created something more akin to traditional tape music than the industrial soundscapes that I tend towards in my /musique concrète/ work, so that was cool and fun to discover. It does indeed seem that interesting things can be created when constraints are placed on creativity! (That is a theme presented in a really cool passage from an essay by Stravinsky that has often intrigued me as a concept.)

The vocal sounds are great.
What is the goal of the non-vocal sounds?
The different sounds didn't seem to be in the same acoustic context/spatiality. I did not really understand this in the context of the recording. Was it intentional? If you want to change this, it could perhaps have reverb applied to the output track instead of just the vocals to blend them together more.
The ending seemed abrupt. Was that intentional?

The selection of space was interesting, as is the spatiality of the individual sounds within it (there are some near-sounding sounds, and some distant-sounding sounds, and the contrast is effective).
The ending seemed abrupt. Was that intentional?
The recording was quite quiet overall. I think it could use some compression and/or normalization to make it easier to hear.
