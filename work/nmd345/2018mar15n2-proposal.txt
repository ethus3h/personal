Content-Neutral Document Format: Native-App Port

This project will manage the development of an interactive way to present musical works to form a portfolio for musicians. It will take the form of a software application that should, given simple text files in a specified format defining data to be presented, generate a set of Web pages. The generated Web pages should present the specified information in an organized and simple-to-read manner, and provide a way to experience the specified musical works in the Web browser, using HTML5 to provide streaming listening of the music. When JavaScript is available to the client Web browser, an interactive audio wave-form should be displayed that can be clicked to jump to a specified point in the audio, thereby allowing viewers to navigate the audio visually without having to memorize specific time-codes. A complete navigation system should be provided, to allow navigation within the various types of musical works specified by date, alphabetically, or if relevant, by associated graphics (e.g. album artwork). The implementation of this project should be modular such that it can be trivially expanded to handle other types of media, such as text and video (the music-specific parts of the code should be separated from the general program logic).
