Content-Neutral Document Format: Native-App Port

I have begun implementing a JavaScript implementation of a content-neutral document format, which would eliminate the artificial restrictions imposed by the distinctions between various types of media in electronic information systems. The current implementation uses JavaScript, and runs in a Web browser, although it was written with portability as a goal and so all browser-specific logic is in a separate file. This proposal suggests developing additional code and integration logic to allow the document format to be used in native platforms, such as from a POSIX-style command-line interface, rather than from a Web browser. While the document implementation code can be reused, the platform APIs it relies on need porting and implementation work; command-line interface wrapper apps would also need to be developed. As an extended goal for this project, implementing an automated test runner that could check that the unit tests pass on both platforms would also be valuable.
