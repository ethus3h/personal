Is the user experience to -simply- simplify
    life, or is it to -provide a hidden

Laziness vs. productivity.

              experiences they have had to shape
              the user interface.

                                ⛤ programmed into it
              by asking it, rather than having to
              go to a We<ambig>d,b</ambig> search to get it.
              This solves the problem of the
              user having to task-switch
              in the middle of work — -task<[?]>\-</[?]> task-switching
              while trying to work on something is
              often stressful and can make
              one lose one's train of thought, so this
              tool could improve Pat's productivity &
              reduce their stress levels.
