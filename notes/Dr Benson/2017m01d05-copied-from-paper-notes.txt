NEED to fix sleep schedule ‚Äî HAVE to make 11.30/7.30 target times to do school. ‚õ§ ‚õ§‚õ§‚õ§ ‚ò∫
I didn't listen to the 10.30 computer-off alarm.
Motivation for the BIG picture ‚Üê This applies to procrastination as well.
don't focus on my immediate gratification when my alarm goes off.
Latch this schedule ABSOLUTELY.
Tracker 100% ‚Äî aim for this! ‚ò∫‚Äçü•Ü ‚åñ

DO TODAY!üï¥
Type up too.
The mind is occupied by tiredness ‚Äî just thinking about the tiredness is a drain from the energy. ‚áíTake walk? Relax ‚Äî anyway ‚Äî get the brain relaxeder. Be reminded of that the trees growing & leaves falling are not something I have a responsibility for. Trees not always available though ‚Äî meditate? Do seated meditation perhaps on breath). Will be more productive overall with some immediately unproductive‚Äìseeming meditation. (Breath mindfulness meditation.) Rejuvinating/reactivating break for a sluggish mind. (Computery stuff is not nearly as helpful.) And have a drink of water. Water w/ stuff has different effect.
Purposeful drinking of water. (Mindful.)
‚õ§ DO THINGS FROM THIS SHEET. TODAY. START BY TYPING IT UP.
What am I aware of in the here and now? Not abt wants or past or future.
Practice mindfulness. (Can be a substitute for napping too!)
Do everything I have scheduled for a given day FIRST, then I am free to do unscheduled things.
Those things I do when I'm procrastinating aren't necessarily unimportant, but they are unimportant in the now/in the short term, relative to whatever I'm scheduled to be doing.
Be rigid about tracker.
It's not that I don't want to do these things I procrastinate on ‚Äî just that I don't want to do them right now. I do want to do them.
Computer stuff can be a "reward" after doing schoolwork when looking at the short term (even though the schoolwork (its results anyway) are rewards in the long term).
